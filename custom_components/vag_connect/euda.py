"""EU Data Act (EUDA) abstraction shim — v2.0.0 (Big-Bang) preview.

The EU Data Act, Article 3, takes effect **September 2026**. It mandates
that car OEMs expose vehicle-data to end users (and chosen third parties)
via a documented API. COVESA recommends VSS / VISS as the standard
schema; binding is non-binding so each OEM may pick its own surface.

This module is **interface-only** for v2.0.0. It establishes the
architectural seam (one ABC + two adapter shells) so that when an OEM
publishes their EUDA endpoint, only the inner adapter's ``get_signal``
method needs implementing — the integration's brand clients, coordinator,
and entity layers already consume an ``EUDADataSource`` indirectly via
the existing ``VehicleData`` parser.

### Why ship the shim now (vs. waiting for binding)

1. **Six-month buffer**: between v2.0.0 ship + Sept 2026 deadline.
2. **Refactor cost is in the call sites, not the surface**: by adding
   the shim now, no future PR has to plumb a new dependency through
   the brand clients.
3. **Cross-integration alignment**: audi_connect_ha + volkswagencarnet
   are tracking the same deadline; landing the same ABC name + signature
   makes a future consolidation possible.

### Adapters

- ``LegacyEUDAAdapter`` — wraps the current Cariad-BFF / OLA / mysmob /
  PPA / VW NA path. ``get_signal`` raises ``NotImplementedError`` until
  the EUDA path goes live; today's polling continues unchanged.
- ``VSSEUDAAdapter`` — placeholder for the upcoming VSS / VISS
  endpoint. ``get_signal`` raises ``NotImplementedError`` until OEMs
  publish their VSS surface (expected mid-2026).

    Implementations expose the OEM's EUDA-compliant vehicle-data surface

    ``get_signal`` coroutine. Brand clients will eventually take an
    ``EUDADataSource`` constructor parameter so unit tests can swap a
    fake adapter in without monkey-patching the network layer.

    The schema is intentionally signal-path-based (e.g.
    ``Vehicle.Powertrain.TractionBattery.StateOfCharge.Current``) so
    callers can use the canonical VSS path even when the underlying
    adapter speaks Cariad-BFF JSON. Adapters do path translation.
