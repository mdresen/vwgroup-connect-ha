"""Command dispatcher — per-VIN per-command-class lock + cooldown state.

v1.25.0 PR-D Foundation: extracts the lock-map + wake-cooldown state
out of `coordinator.py`'s lazy-init `if not hasattr(self, ...)` smell
into a properly-typed helper class. Coordinator now holds
``self._dispatcher: CommandDispatcher`` and forwards lock/cooldown
queries through it.

**This is Phase 1A** — the helper class is established; the 30+
``async_lock`` / ``async_unlock`` / ``async_start_climate`` / etc.
command-method bodies stay in ``coordinator.py`` for now (~750 LOC
that the original Sprint-C-Plan PR-C envisioned moving). Phase 2
of the coordinator refactor (= moving those methods into the
dispatcher proper, plus extracting CapabilityCache + EnrichmentService)
is deferred to **v1.26.0** — see ``docs/SPRINT_C_v1.25.0_PLAN.md``
"After-v1.25.0 Roadmap" + "Out-of-Scope for v1.25.0".

Pragmatic rationale:
- v1.25.0 already ships massive user-visible value (cross-brand
  parity wins, listener pattern, GPS hardening, write-side bundle,
  UX/UI mega-bundle, MBB Phase 2)
- A 1-2 day pure-architectural refactor with **zero user benefit**
  doesn't fit "MVP-haft fortschreiten" (Prash 2026-05-09)
- The dispatcher class established here makes the v1.26.0 Phase 2
  extraction mechanical: each method moves intact, just changes
  ``self.X`` → ``self._coordinator.X``

The Phase 1A work itself: removes a code smell (lazy-init via
hasattr) + creates the architectural marker. Coordinator size
delta is small but the new module signals intent.
