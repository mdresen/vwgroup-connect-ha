"""v2.2.0 — Model-Year / Platform quirk-suppression table.

Closes a bug-class the existing ``_capabilities.py`` Phase 3 layer
can't catch: **firmware regressions where the backend reports a
capability as available but the actual API endpoint silently fails**.

Examples reported by competitor projects in 2026:

- **CUPRA Born MY24-MY25** — backend ``capabilities[]`` includes
  ``access`` (lock/unlock) but POST to ``/api/v2/access/{vin}/unlock``
  returns 400 with no error body. Confirmed by pycupra #79.

- **Formentor PHEV (current gen)** — ``engines.primary`` key missing
  from ``mycar`` response despite capability ``engines`` advertised
  as supported. Confirmed by pycupra #76 (parser crash).

- **Audi Q6 e-tron / A6 e-tron (PPE platform, MY24+)** — backend
  advertises ``parameters`` but the actual response uses a different
  schema shape entirely. Confirmed by audi_connect_ha #686.

### How this differs from `_capabilities.py`

| Layer | What it catches | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| `_capabilities.py` | Capability MISSING in backend response | Backend `capabilities[]` endpoint |
| `_my_quirks.py`    | Capability ADVERTISED but BROKEN     | Known-bad firmware list (manual) |

Both layers run before entity creation. Either layer returning
"suppress" hides the entity. Catch-and-release semantics:

1. ``_capabilities.cap_id_for(brand, command)`` → backend lookup
2. ``_my_quirks.is_command_suppressed(brand, model, my, command)`` → manual list
3. If either says hide → entity not created

### How to add a quirk

When a competitor reports a Born MY26 firmware silently breaking
``command_set_target_soc``:

    QUIRKS.append(MYQuirk(
        brand="cupra",
        model_glob="Born",          # case-insensitive substring
        year_min=2026, year_max=None,  # MY26+ until further notice
        suppress_commands={"command_set_target_soc"},
        source="pycupra #XXX (date)",
    ))

That's it — the next coordinator update will hide the entity for any
matching VIN without entity-ID renames or user-visible churn.
