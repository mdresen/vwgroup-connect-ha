"""Vehicle Data Scout — detects JSON fields the parser doesn't read.

Mirrors the `tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity-*` "Unexpected Keys found"
pattern that has been our richest source of API findings (CC-seatcupra
issue #109 with Rainer's CUPRA Born live dump, CC-skoda issue #50 with
the Kodiaq iV 2026 complete response).

Architecture:
- Pure data layer: ``EXPECTED_KEYS`` declares paths we already read; the
  ``detect_unexpected`` function walks an actual response and yields
  ``UnexpectedField`` entries for paths NOT in the expected set.
- Privacy: every yielded sample value is anonymised via ``mask_value``
  (VIN/userID/GPS/email/token redaction) before leaving this module.
- Brand-agnostic: the EXPECTED_KEYS table is keyed by ``(brand, endpoint)``
  so each brand client can register its known shape.

Usage from a brand client::

    from cariad._unexpected_keys import detect_unexpected
    findings = list(detect_unexpected("skoda", "vehicle-status", raw_status))
    if findings:
        coordinator.record_unexpected_keys(vin, findings)
