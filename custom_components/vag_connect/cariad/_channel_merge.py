"""Cross-channel data merge (b1/C1).

VW EU vehicles can be reachable over several read channels at once, each
carrying a *different* slice of the truth — e.g. for a Golf GTE:

    brand-native / MBB  → fuel level, commands
    EU Data Act portal  → SoC, charging, climate
    vw.de web (authproxy) → VIN, odometer, service, master data

No single channel is complete, so this layer takes the per-channel snapshots
for one VIN and produces a single merged ``VehicleData`` that is the union of
what each channel knows. This generalises the long-standing endpoint-specific
fuel merge (BFF ← MBB VSR) into a field-level, provenance-tracked union.

Pure + deterministic — no I/O, no HA imports. The coordinator owns *when* to
call it; this module only owns *how* the snapshots combine.

Merge rule (gap-fill, priority order):
- ``sources`` are ordered highest-trust first.
- For every field, the first non-None value in priority order wins. A channel
  therefore never overwrites a higher-trust channel's reading; it only fills
  gaps. Disjoint fields (the common case) combine without conflict.
- Drivetrain flags are unioned across all channels (additive detection) and
  ``is_electric`` / ``is_hybrid`` are re-derived from the merged result.
- ``source_channel`` records the channels that actually contributed a value.
