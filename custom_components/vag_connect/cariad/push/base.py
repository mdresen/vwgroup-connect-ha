# v2.2.0 Phase 3 PR #12/20 — circuit-breaker tuning.
#
# After ``CIRCUIT_BREAKER_MAX_STRIKES`` consecutive failed-start
# attempts the manager trips into the ``TRIPPED`` state, where:
# - subsequent ``start()`` calls return immediately without retrying
# - state-property surfaces the trip for diagnostics + Repair-Issue
# - operator can manually reset via ``reset_circuit_breaker()``
# - auto-recovery happens after ``CIRCUIT_BREAKER_AUTO_RESET_SEC``
#
# Three strikes chosen empirically: a single transient failure is
# common (DNS hiccup, broker rolling restart) and shouldn't trip;
# three in a row almost always means a structural issue (creds rotated,
# deps removed, IDP migrated) that won't self-heal in the retry loop.
#
# Auto-reset at 1h matches the typical token-rotation window — by
# the time we auto-retry, refresh-token state should have moved on
# from whatever was failing.
