"""Bentley My Bentley API client — Cariad-BFF backend.

v2.14.11 — ACTIVATED (login + read). The 2026-06-18 app-atlas resolved the
former placeholders from ``uk.co.bentley.mybentley``: the production IDK
client_id (``idkClientIDLive`` in the app's ``url-configuration.json``) is
byte-identical to Audi's primary, and the redirect_uri is ``mybentleyapp:///``
(both now set in ``BRAND_BENTLEY``). Wired into ``CariadClientFactory``,
``BRANDS`` and the config-flow UI.

Bentley runs on the Audi IDK client + tenant (Bentley = Audi platform), so
the data path inherits unchanged from ``VWEUClient``.

**Two-way is still live-test gated:** the qmauth/CARIAD assertion headers are
gated to audi/volkswagen in ``idk.py``, so Bentley's classic token exchange
degrades to the read-only data_act_portal until a tester with a real My
Bentley account confirms the Audi qmauth secret is accepted for client
09b6cbec under the bentleyid tenant. At that point ``"bentley"`` is added to
those gates to unlock commands.

    Unlike ``AudiClient`` (which exchanges for an AZS token to fetch
    vgql render images), Bentley doesn't have a separate vgql
    endpoint — vehicle images come from the standard Cariad-BFF
    image endpoint. So we don't need a separate token exchange.
