"""CUPRA-standalone API client — brand-isolated backend (scaffold).

**BETA — TESTER VALIDATION PENDING.** Third luxury/standalone scaffold
in Phase 4 alongside ``lambo.py`` (PR #15) and ``bentley.py`` (PR #16),
but with a meaningfully different inheritance story:

  - Lambo / Bentley → ``VWEUClient`` (Cariad-BFF backend, same as VW/Audi)
  - CUPRA-standalone → ``SeatCupraClient`` (OLA-flavoured backend, same
    parser surface as the existing CUPRA path)

**What's distinct from existing CUPRA (``seat_cupra.py``)**: the current
CUPRA integration goes through the shared SEAT/CUPRA OLA backend
(``ola.prod.code.seat.cloud.vwgroup.com``). Per pycupra commit 0f3b1c7
+ multiple 2026-Q1/Q2 community reports, CUPRA Connect is progressively
migrating to a brand-isolated backend (rumoured host
``cupra-api.vwgroup.io``) expected to fully cut over by 2026-H2.

Once a tester's account flips to the standalone backend, they can:

  1. Confirm the actual host (currently PLACEHOLDER in BRAND_CUPRA_STANDALONE)
  2. Exercise the parser against the cut-over response shapes
  3. Report back which endpoints stayed identical vs. drifted

This scaffold inherits ``SeatCupraClient`` so 95% of the parser surface
is already correct (OLA-flavoured JSON, same authentication, same
capability schema). The only override is the API base host via
``BRAND_CUPRA_STANDALONE``.

Until tester validation:
- NOT wired into ``CariadClientFactory``
- NOT exposed in the config-flow UI
- A tester can manually instantiate ``CupraStandaloneClient(...)``
  in a debug-script

"In our profession, precision matters. Especially when reserving
brand-IDs for backend cut-overs that haven't fully cut over yet."
