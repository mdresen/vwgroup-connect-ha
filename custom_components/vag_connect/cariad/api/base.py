        - Skipped entirely when ``last_rate_limit_remaining`` is at or
          below ``_PROBE_TOKEN_GUARD`` — protects the user's daily quota.
        - Skipped entirely after ``_PROBE_CB_THRESHOLD`` consecutive
          pass-level failures (auth-storm circuit-breaker).
        - Per-probe HTTP timeout ``_PROBE_TIMEOUT_S`` (short, best-effort).
        - Total per-pass time budget ``_PROBE_BUDGET_S`` (bail if exceeded).
        - 401/403/404/5xx/network errors are swallowed silently per-probe;
          a 401 NEVER triggers ``_refresh_tokens`` here (would be a storm
          risk). On 401 the entire pass aborts and increments the

          under a ``v3_probe:<probe_name>`` key. The coordinator runs the
          same ``detect_unexpected`` walk it always does and emits scout
          telemetry for any new field paths.
