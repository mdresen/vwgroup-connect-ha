"""Lamborghini Unica API client — NOT a Cariad-BFF brand (do NOT wire).

v2.14.11 — the 2026-06-18 app-atlas (``lamborghini.connectedcar``) DISPROVED
the original "same Cariad-BFF as Audi/VW EU" assumption. Lamborghini Unica:
- ships **NO** ``@apps_vw-dilab_com`` IDK client_id anywhere in the APK;
- authenticates via **MBB co-auth proxied through Lamborghini's own SDP
  gateway**: token endpoint ``https://sdp.lamborghini.com/unicav2/mbbcoauth``,
  scope ``sc2:fal``; the real VW MBB client_id is held SERVER-SIDE on the SDP
  proxy and is never shipped in the app;
- uses AWS Cognito only as an analytics identity-pool (Pinpoint), not login.

Therefore this ``LamboClient(VWEUClient)`` subclass is the WRONG shape — the
IDK/Cariad-BFF login path it inherits cannot speak the SDP-proxy MBB flow, and
``BRAND_LAMBO.api_base = emea.bff.cariad.digital`` is incorrect. Integrating
Lamborghini needs a dedicated SDP-proxy MBB-co-auth adapter (Tier-3 project)
whose request shape can only be derived from a live mitmproxy capture of a
real Unica login — not from static APK analysis.

Kept as documentation only: NOT wired into ``CariadClientFactory`` / ``BRANDS``
/ config-flow, and must stay that way until the SDP-proxy adapter exists.
