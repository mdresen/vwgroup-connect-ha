"""Capability-ID Mapping per Brand — Single Source of Truth.

v1.13.0 (#56 Phase 3) — when an HA platform's ``async_setup_entry``
decides whether to register a command-bound entity, it asks
``coordinator.command_capability_supported(vin, command_id)``. That
helper translates the integration-level command name (e.g.
``"command_flash"``) into the brand-specific capability ID (e.g.
``"honkAndFlash"`` for VW EU CARIAD-BFF, ``"honk-and-flash"`` for
SEAT/CUPRA OLA, ``"honk-and-flash"`` for Skoda mysmob) before
querying the capability cache.

Why this lives in its own module:
- Pre-v1.13.0 the brand→cap-id mapping was implicit — Phase 2 only
  recorded post-failure outcomes (`MISSING_CAPABILITY`) and the
  brand-string never mattered.
- Phase 3 needs to PRE-decide; that requires a stable lookup table.
- Putting it in const.py would mix infra constants with business
  vocabulary; here it's a focused single-source-of-truth that the
  research notes (`docs/RESEARCH_NOTES_2026-05-02.md`) reference
  directly.

Design rules:
- Keep the table CONSERVATIVE — when in doubt, do NOT add a
  capability mapping. Phase 3 falls through to Phase 2 (which
  catches at runtime) if no cap-id is registered.
- Annotate confidence with comments per row: ✅ verified in production
  vs ⚠️ [Inference] vs ❌ unknown.
- New brands (vw_na, porsche) start empty — capabilities discovered
  via Vehicle Data Scout reports get added here once verified.

# Per-brand: command-id → capability-id string.

# When a row is missing from a brand's table, ``command_capability_supported``
