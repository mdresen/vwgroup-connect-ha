# VIN that was OFFLINE on the previous poll cycle, sleeps
# CONF_WAKE_DELAY_SECONDS, then runs the regular status fetch. Closes
# the offline-car null-cascade reports (#306 DanielBie SEAT/CUPRA,

# per VIN lives under CONF_DATA_ACT_IDENTIFIERS in entry.options.

# wall) instead of the token-based CARIAD BFF. STRICTLY additive: only honoured

# coordinator hands them to the brand client so ``_arm_website_proxy`` hydrates
# the cookie jar BEFORE ``begin_login()`` — an already-authenticated session
# redirects straight back to volkswagen.de WITHOUT re-prompting the email-OTP,
# which was previously raised on every setup/restart. The jar rotates on each
# successful login/refresh, so the coordinator writes the fresh cookies back to
# the entry. STRICTLY additive: only ever read/written for website-authproxy

# v2.8.0 quick-win B — native-app deeplink schemes per brand. Used by

# subscribe to in order to open the brand's mobile app on iOS/Android.
# Values sourced from each brand's published intent-filter scheme
# (Android AndroidManifest.xml + iOS Info.plist CFBundleURLSchemes).
# Map of brand -> base URL; the action is appended as a path segment
# if the app supports it (the dashboard card decides whether to keep
# or strip the action based on platform behaviour).
#
# v2.10.0 — verification status: the smali extractions in _private/ carry
# qmauth + x_headers + oauth client_ids + token URLs but not the URI scheme
# strings (those live in AndroidManifest.xml + iOS Info.plist, not in the
# decompiled bytecode). Until a fresh manifest sweep is added the schemes
# stay as published in each brand's launcher metadata + community deeplink
# reports. The schemes open the apps reliably; the action path appended
# after ``://`` may not always land on the expected screen — the dashboard
# card falls back to opening the app's home screen on path-mismatch.
