# subscription-counting commands.

# ``targetTemperature*`` MUST BE OMITTED (audi_connect_ha PR #644 + #677).

#     imports for Skoda MQTT TOTP, so opting into either backend
#     triggers the same install requirement)

#     verification

# Polling interval limits
# v1.17.0 — defaults raised after community research (pycupra
# README + WulfgarW/homeassistant-pycupra release notes): the
# MyCupra/MySeat portal has a per-day API call limit of ~1,500 across
# the official mobile app + integrations. Default 5 min = 288 polls/day
# already eats ~20% of the daily budget BEFORE the official app even
# logs in. Pycupra recommends ≥ 600 s (10 min) by default, ≥ 900 s
# (15 min) when push is enabled. Min raised from 3 min → 5 min.
# Existing entries with explicit lower values are not coerced upward
# at upgrade — only the default for fresh installs changes.
