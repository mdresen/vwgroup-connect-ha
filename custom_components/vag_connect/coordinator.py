"""Coordinator for VAG Connect — async polling via own CARIAD API client.

Data flow:
  CARIAD client polls VAG API → poll_loop pushes to HA via async_set_updated_data

Thread safety:
  _vehicles_lock (threading.Lock) guards self.vehicles.

        """Return ``True`` / ``False`` / ``None`` for a capability lookup.

        - ``True``  — capability is present in the cached document and has
          no documented limitations (empty ``status`` array on OLA, or
          ``active=True`` AND ``user-enabled != False`` on Skoda mysmob).
        - ``False`` — capability is present but the backend lists explicit
          limitations, OR the cache is populated and the capability is not
          listed at all (callers can treat both as "do not show entity").
        - ``None``  — no cached document for this VIN yet (e.g. brand has
          no capabilities endpoint, or the prefetch failed). Callers must
          NOT hide entities in this case — the data simply isn't there.

        Conservative on purpose: returns ``None`` for unknown rather than
        guessing. Only an explicit cache hit warrants gating decisions.

        v1.13.0 (#56 Phase 3 prerequisite) — extended schema-tolerance:
        Skoda mysmob uses ``{active, editable, user-enabled, status,
        license-issue, parameters}`` instead of CARIAD-BFF's bare
        ``{id, status}``. This helper now treats:
        - ``status``: empty list / missing → True (CARIAD pattern)
        - ``active``: explicit False → False (Skoda pattern)
        - ``user-enabled``: explicit False → False (Skoda pattern)
        - ``license-issue``: present + truthy → False (Skoda paid feature)
        Mixed cases (e.g. CARIAD vehicle whose response has ``active``
        too) require ALL truthy signals to return True.

        v1.15.0 — additionally tolerates the new transient-state values
        documented in ``skodaconnect/myskoda/models/capability.py`` post
        PR #533: ``INSUFFICIENT_BATTERY_LEVEL``, ``LOCATION_DATA_DISABLED``,
        ``VEHICLE_DISABLED`` are status entries that mean "currently
        can't" (not "permanently can't"). They still count as "gated
        right now" — but logged so a future surface-feature can show
        the user "your battery is too low to start climate" instead of
        the entity just disappearing. Also tolerates the new top-level
        ``errors[]`` block on capabilities responses (introduced in
        myskoda PR #543) — explicit error means False without crashing.

        Used by platform ``async_setup_entry`` functions to filter

        - ``None``  → cache empty / brand without capability map / unknown
