"""b13 (#465 RaAdNe) — duplicate same-name data-point disambiguation.

VW's portal returns several data points with the SAME logical name (e.g. four
``target_soc`` candidates, two ``soc`` values). We must pick by genuine
freshness, never by array order, and a field nested inside an array (e.g. a
charge profile) must not clobber the active top-level value.
