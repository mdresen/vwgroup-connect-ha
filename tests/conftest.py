"""Test-suite root config.

v1.24.1 (2026-05-08 audit): adds the repo root to ``sys.path`` so that
``import custom_components.vag_connect.*`` works without an editable
install. Also marks tests that need Home Assistant infrastructure as
``ha_required`` — they get skipped automatically if the ``homeassistant``
package isn't importable, so contributors can run pure-Python tests
locally with just ``pip install -r requirements-test.txt``.

CI installs ``homeassistant`` ad-hoc and runs the full matrix; locally
we keep the entry barrier low.
