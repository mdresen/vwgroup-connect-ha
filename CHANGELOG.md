## [2.15.0a9] - 2026-06-22

> **Alpha / pre-release** — small fix from a tester report (#442).

### Fixed

- **Climatisation no longer shows as "on" when the car can't actually start it.** On some Audi/VW cars the climatisation status comes back as `invalid` — a no-data state the car returns when climatisation can't run, e.g. at a low battery. The integration was treating anything that wasn't an explicit "off" as "running", so the climatisation binary sensor flipped on by mistake. It now treats those no-data states as off, so the sensor reflects reality.

## [2.15.0a8] - 2026-06-22

> **Alpha / pre-release** — small but important UX fix from a tester report (#498).

### Fixed

- **The MBB login now tells newer ID / MEB owners why it can't work, instead of looping the VIN screen.** If the durable MBB login returns `Unknown user`, that means the car is a newer ID.3/4/5 / MEB model that was never enrolled in the legacy Car-Net backend — so the durable login + remote commands genuinely can't reach it. Instead of bouncing you back to the VIN form with a cryptic error, the flow now stops with a clear message pointing you to the EU Data Act portal (or email + password) for those vehicles. The MBB login is for older Car-Net cars (most PHEV / combustion models).

## [2.15.0a7] - 2026-06-22

> **Alpha / pre-release — the "Endstufe" two-way test.** The deep dive settled what the durable VW login can and can't do, and this build ships the part that genuinely works durably: **remote commands**. No re-add needed — update and restart, then try a command.

### Added

- **Durable two-way commands over the MBB login: climate, charging and charge target.** The investigation proved the durable (password-free) VW login can't *read* live data — VW closed that path for this token type — but it CAN issue **commands** (the command path does an extra authorisation step that reads don't). So with the MBB login + your S-PIN you now get durable **climate start/stop, window heating, charging start/stop, and set charge target %** — and these keep working across restarts, no app-attestation, no ~1‑hour re-login.
- **Country-agnostic by design.** Commands are routed through the car's own service directory (the operationList), which hands over the right server per service per market — so this works for German, Austrian, Dutch, etc. VW EU vehicles, not just the Swiss car it was discovered on. Each command is only attempted if the directory says your car+subscription actually allows it (so you don't waste S-PIN tries on a 403).

> ⚠️ **Live-test the commands deliberately.** The command bodies are grounded against the classic Car-Net app + the car's own directory but haven't been actuated on every model — try one (e.g. start climate) and check it acts. A wrong S‑PIN counts toward the 3‑try lock, so the integration refuses to act when the car reports you're down to your last attempt. Reads still come from your other channel (EU Data Act / the existing login) — the MBB login is login + licence + commands.

## [2.15.0a6] - 2026-06-21

> **Alpha / pre-release** — the diagnostics paid off. Live probing revealed the durable VW login works perfectly *and* reads data — the empty status on the test car was simply an **expired We Connect subscription** (every paid service was off). This build reads the car's service directory so it knows that, and tells you instead of failing silently. No re-add needed — update and restart.

### Added

- **The MBB integration now reads your vehicle's "service directory" (operationList).** This is the authoritative list of which connected services your car has and whether they're licensed/active. From it the integration now:
  - **tells you when your We Connect / connect subscription is expired or inactive** — the `subscription_active` / subscription-expiry / days-remaining sensors are populated, and the log says "renew it in the app" instead of dumping cryptic 403 errors;
  - **skips the status read entirely when the subscription is inactive** (it would only 403), so the log stays clean and the poll is faster;
  - lays the groundwork for the full command set later (the directory hands over the exact per-service hosts and the granted remote-commands for climate, charging and timers).

> ℹ️ If your car shows everything "unknown" and `subscription_active` is off, that's the cause — renew We Connect for that vehicle (or test on a car with an active subscription) and the data flows. The durable login itself is working.

## [2.15.0a5] - 2026-06-21

> **Alpha / pre-release** — diagnostics build. a4 got the car to appear via the VIN; now the status read returns nothing, so this surfaces exactly why. No re-add needed — just update and restart.

### Changed

- **MBB status read now logs exactly what the server returns.** Your Golf GTE shows up but all sensors are "unknown" — to pin down whether the status endpoint rejects the token, returns an empty body, or returns data in a shape we don't yet map, the read now logs the host/country it used and, on an empty result, the exact field IDs (or envelope keys) the car returned. This is the same diagnostic approach that pinned the garage issue in one step.

## [2.15.0a4] - 2026-06-21

> **Alpha / pre-release** — second live-test follow-up. The diagnostics from a3 pinned the exact blocker, and this fixes it.

### Fixed

- **MBB: you now enter your VIN directly, and the car finally appears.** The a3 diagnostics showed the durable VW token is allowed to read your *car* but not to list your *account's garage* (the server replied `403 — no permission for systemId XID_APP_VW`). That's expected for this token type — so the MBB login now has a **VIN field**: enter your 17-character VIN (windscreen / registration; comma-separate multiple cars) and the integration uses it directly. Everything car-level — status, and lock/unlock with your S-PIN — works with this token; only the garage *listing* didn't, and the VIN field replaces it.

> ℹ️ **If you already added the MBB login on a2/a3:** delete that entry and add it again with the new "Volkswagen EU — Durable Login (MBB)" option so you can enter the VIN. The browser confirm is quick.

## [2.15.0a3] - 2026-06-21

> **Alpha / pre-release** — follow-up to a2 from the first live test. The MBB durable login itself worked end-to-end (browser confirm → durable token); the only blocker was finding your cars afterwards.

### Fixed

- **MBB: the car list is now looked up with the right country and headers.** On the first live test the durable VW login succeeded but the integration found no vehicles, because the account-list call was hardcoded to Germany (`DE`) and was missing the app-identification headers the VW servers expect. It now reads your account's country from the login token (e.g. `CH` for Switzerland), sends the `Volkswagen`/`myAudi` app headers on every MBB call, and tries the known server/country combinations until your cars appear.
- **Better diagnostics:** if the car list still comes back empty, the log now shows the exact HTTP status for each server/country it tried (instead of a vague "APIError"), so the endpoint can be pinned down quickly.

## [2.15.0a2] - 2026-06-21

> **Alpha / pre-release** — please live-test and report back. Expect rough edges.

### Added

- **Volkswagen EU durable login (MBB) — now a real option in the integration, not just a test script.** There's a new sign-in choice "Volkswagen EU — Durable Login (MBB)": you confirm once in your browser (no password stored in Home Assistant) and the integration keeps a long-lived, self-refreshing session that survives restarts — unlike the read-only portal. Add your S-PIN in the options to also get **two-way lock/unlock**. VW-only, alpha — the status read works best for combustion/PHEV (fuel level, range, AdBlue) for now; EV battery fields via this path come later.
- **Remote lock/unlock over the MBB path**, using the classic security-PIN handshake. The S-PIN is checked locally before anything is sent so a typo can't burn one of your three tries, and the integration refuses to act if the car reports you're down to your last attempt (3 wrong PINs locks it until you reset in the car/app).

> ⚠️ The durable VW path needs a confirmation from your account to fully verify end-to-end on real cars — that's exactly what this alpha is for. If lock/unlock reports a failure with the doors open or the key inside the car, that's the car refusing, not a bug.

### Internal (MBB hardening, pre-release review)

- The MBB session now auto-refreshes when its token expires (previously the durable token could go stale after a restart and the car would show "unknown" until you re-confirmed in the browser — the whole point of "durable" is that it shouldn't).
- Tightened token isolation: several background calls (capability/trip-stats prefetch, the field-probe pass, wake, charging-station lookup) are now skipped for MBB sessions so the MBB token is only ever sent to the MBB servers, never to the (dead, for VW) app backend.

## [2.15.0a1] - 2026-06-20

> **Alpha / pre-release** — ships the latest reverse-engineering findings for live testing. Expect rough edges; please report what you see.

### Added

- **Bentley is now a selectable brand (login + read).** My Bentley runs on the same backend as Audi, so it slots straight in. Two-way (commands) for Bentley is a follow-up.
- **Login resilience for Škoda, SEAT and CUPRA.** If the app's login key ever gets rotated by the manufacturer, the integration now has spare keys to fall back to automatically — so a rotation doesn't lock you out.
- **VW Group app-atlas research** in `docs/research/` — a catalogue of every brand app's login scheme, plus the discovery of a durable, refreshable login path for Volkswagen that gets past the new app-attestation wall. A local test tool (`scripts/mbb_dag_test.py`) lets you verify the VW path against your own account via a confirmation link (your credentials stay in your browser; it never prints tokens).

### Changed

- **Project relicensed to GNU AGPL v3.0-or-later** (was Apache-2.0). Forks must stay open-source under the same license. See [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md) for the attribution + naming terms, and consider supporting the project via GitHub Sponsors.

### Fixed

- The advanced OLA User-Agent override for SEAT/CUPRA is no longer silently overwritten, so it actually applies now.

## [2.14.10] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **volkswagen.de website login (beta): the email code is finally accepted instead of looping with a new code every time.** Entering the emailed code kept failing as a "credential issue", and a fresh code was sent after each attempt. The login page's code box isn't always named the same thing internally, and the integration was filling in the wrong one — so the identity service saw an empty code, rejected it, and emailed a new one, over and over. It now fills whichever code box the page actually shows (and ticks "remember this browser" when offered, so the saved session lasts longer). (Opt-in beta channel only.)

## [2.14.9] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **volkswagen.de website login (beta): a restart now actually resumes the session instead of looping / asking for a new email code.** This was the real root cause behind the redirect loop on resume. The single-sign-on cookie that keeps you logged in lives only on the identity host and has no domain attached, so the old code quietly dropped it when saving and never restored it — which meant a restart had no valid session to resume and bounced back to the login page. The login cookies (the SSO one included) are now captured and restored across both hosts, so a restart silently reuses your session. A stale session reported as `412`/`428` (not just `401`/`403`) now also correctly triggers a clean re-login. (Opt-in beta channel only.)

## [2.14.8] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **EU Data Act portal: a slow/unreachable portal no longer errors the whole poll — it just means "no data this poll".** When the portal was sluggish, the request could time out at the network layer (before any response), and that timeout slipped past the retry logic and surfaced as an error (the spike of auto-reported `TimeoutError`s on June 16). Now a timeout or dropped connection is retried with the same short backoff as a transient server error, and if it keeps failing the poll quietly skips and tries again next cycle — instead of erroring or, worse, forcing a pointless re-login. Affects both the data-listing and the dataset-download steps.

## [2.14.7] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **volkswagen.de website login (beta): redirect-chain debug logging, so a stuck login can finally be diagnosed.** When the website login bounces in a loop, the error message is redacted (it can carry tokens), which made the root cause invisible from a normal log. This adds a `DEBUG`-level, hostname-only trace of the redirect chain (and the resume-probe result) — e.g. `volkswagen.de → identity.vwgroup.io → volkswagen.de → …`. Only hostnames are logged; paths and query strings (where the OAuth `state`/tokens live) are never written. Turn on debug logging for `custom_components.vag_connect` to capture it. No functional change — purely diagnostics for the beta channel.

## [2.14.6] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **volkswagen.de website login (beta) now actually resumes a saved session instead of re-logging-in every time.** v2.14.5 stopped the redirect-loop crash, but it still kicked you back to a fresh email-OTP whenever the resume wobbled. Now, when the integration comes back up it does a quick, redirect-free check against the data endpoint with your saved cookies: if the session is still good it's adopted straight away — no login dance, no OTP — and only a genuinely expired session falls back to a fresh login. As a belt-and-suspenders extra, the credential step also can't get stuck in a redirect loop anymore. (Opt-in beta channel only; no change for any other brand or mode.)

## [2.14.5] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **volkswagen.de website login (beta) no longer crashes with a redirect loop when resuming a saved session.** When the integration came back up and reused the saved login cookies, the website login could bounce in a redirect loop (`TooManyRedirects`) and surface as a bogus "invalid credentials". It now caps the redirects and handles the two real cases cleanly: an already-logged-in session is recognised straight away (no re-login, no OTP), and a stale-cookie loop is reported as a normal "please re-authenticate" instead of a crash. (Opt-in beta channel only.)

## [2.14.4] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **The "Email 2FA required" repair notice stops throwing translation errors for good.** v2.14.3 supplied the missing `{brand}` value, but a notice already sitting in the repairs list from an older version had no value and kept spamming `MISSING_VALUE` in the logs. The notice title no longer depends on a placeholder at all (all 8 languages), so old and new notices both render cleanly, and the repair description now also gets its `{username}` value supplied. Purely a cosmetics/log-noise fix.

## [2.14.3] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **volkswagen.de website login (beta): you only enter the email code once now, not on every restart.** The beta channel logged you in (code and all) when you set it up, but then threw all that away and started fresh every time Home Assistant restarted — which meant it asked for a new email code on every single restart, and if you weren't there to type it in, the integration just got stuck. It now remembers the login session from setup and reuses it, so a restart picks up where it left off instead of pestering you for another code. If the saved session has genuinely gone stale, it falls back to asking you to sign in again, same as before. The session keeps itself fresh in the background after each successful login. (Opt-in beta channel only; still read-only.)
- **Repair notifications show the brand name properly instead of a literal `{brand}`.** A couple of the "please sign in again" repair prompts (including the email-code one) had a `{brand}` placeholder that wasn't being filled in, so the title could read awkwardly. It now drops in the actual brand (or a sensible fallback) so the message reads cleanly.

## [2.14.2] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **volkswagen.de website login (beta): the email code now submits correctly.** The OTP step was posting just the code + state, but the VW identity email-challenge page is a form with hidden fields (`_csrf` / `relayState` / …) that have to come along — without them the code didn't go through cleanly. It now parses the challenge form exactly like the password step does and submits the code inside the real form, so email-OTP logins complete. (Opt-in beta channel only.)

## [2.14.1] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **System Health no longer falsely reports the VW/Audi backend as unreachable.** The connectivity check pinged an old discovery URL (`/login/v1/idk/openid-configuration`) that VW has started answering with a `403` before you even log in — so Home Assistant's System Health card showed the CARIAD backend as "failed" even when everything was working. It now pings the current endpoint (the same one the login already uses), which answers normally.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- **New opt-in beta way to connect a Volkswagen: the volkswagen.de website (read-only).** There's now a third sign-in option when you add a Volkswagen — "Volkswagen.de website (beta)" — that logs in the same way the volkswagen.de "myVolkswagen" web area does and reads your car through it. The point: that website uses its own server-side login, so it goes around the app-attestation wall that's been killing the normal token logins for VW. You sign in with your Volkswagen ID email + password (and an emailed code if your account asks for one), and you get charge level, range, charging state and power, charge target, plus odometer and service-due info. It's **read-only** — no lock/climate/charge commands — and **opt-in**: you have to pick it on purpose. Nothing changes for anyone who doesn't, every existing setup (app login, browser login, EU Data Act portal) behaves exactly as before. It's a beta and hasn't been verified end-to-end against a live VW account yet, so treat it as experimental.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Fewer dropped polls when the EU Data Act portal is having a moment.** The portal throws transient server errors (500/502/503/504) that come and go within seconds — and until now a single blip meant skipping the whole poll and waiting 15 minutes for the next one. The integration now backs off briefly and retries (a couple of times, a few seconds apart) before giving up as "no data this poll", so a short hiccup no longer costs you a full cycle of data. The "you haven't enabled the data request yet" case (404) still returns instantly with no added delay, and a real auth failure still re-authenticates as before.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-06-13

The EU Data Act portal becomes the **universal read-only safety net**: as VW keeps closing native API access brand by brand (VW EU's token logins are gone, CUPRA/SEAT's online services are now behind a device-attestation wall), each affected brand now degrades gracefully to the read-only portal instead of going dark.

### Fixed

- **CUPRA, SEAT and Škoda now route their data reads through the EU Data Act portal when the portal fallback is active** — not just their login. Until now, when a brand's native backend went dark (e.g. CUPRA/SEAT's online services getting blocked by VW), the login correctly fell back to the read-only portal, but the very next data poll still hit the dead native endpoint — so you'd get a successful login and then no data. These brands now follow the same portal-routing path VW EU already used, both for the vehicle list and the status read. It's the EU Data Act portal becoming the universal read-only safety net: as VW keeps closing native access brand by brand, each one degrades gracefully to the portal instead of going dark. Non-breaking — the native path is completely unchanged whenever the portal fallback isn't engaged.
- **CUPRA/SEAT now actually reach that fallback.** There was a catch: the portal fallback only ever armed when the *login* failed — but for CUPRA/SEAT the login still succeeds and it's only the data call that gets blocked (the 403 device-attestation wall). So the fallback never fired and the previous fix couldn't help. Now, when the native garage call comes back 403 despite a valid login, the integration arms the read-only EU Data Act portal on the spot and serves the vehicle list from there. This is what makes the portal safety net real for the brands that are blocked *today*.
- **Quieter logs in EU Data Act portal mode.** When a car is running on the read-only portal, the integration was still trying the manufacturer-backend "capabilities" call on every setup — which can't work there (the portal session isn't a real backend token) and just logged a `400` every time. It now skips that call in portal mode. Cars on a normal (non-portal) connection are unaffected, including when you've turned on read-only mode yourself.

## [2.12.6] - 2026-06-13

An honesty fix for the CUPRA/SEAT repair notice.

### Changed

- **The CUPRA/SEAT "OLA 403" repair notice now tells the truth.** It used to suggest the app-identifying headers might be outdated and told you to check for an update or try an app-version override — but those 403s are a VW server-side access revocation for SEAT/CUPRA, not anything a header bump or a reconfigure can fix. The notice now says that plainly (in all eight languages), drops the dead-end advice, and notes the integration falls back to the read-only EU Data Act portal where it can (#432, #444, #456, #392).

## [2.12.5] - 2026-06-13

A data-quality patch for the EU Data Act portal, plus a scout-noise fix for Audi.

### Fixed

- **Jumping SoC / odometer on the EU Data Act portal.** The portal ships an unordered event-log, and we were keeping the first value we happened to see for each field (often the oldest), so battery level and mileage bounced around. We now keep the newest value per field by timestamp — the same data-quality problem the whole portal ecosystem hit. Empty / no-content / corrupt portal ZIPs are also handled as "no data this poll" instead of being mistaken for a login failure (which used to trigger a pointless re-login).
- **Audi scout noise on deeper charging timer/profile fields** (#446, #448). The selectivestatus backend started nesting `chargingTimers` / `chargingProfiles` one level deeper (4 segments, e.g. `…Status.value.timers`); registered the deeper wildcards so the Vehicle Data Scout stops re-flagging fields we already read.

### Changed

- Housekeeping: removed an orphaned repair-notice translation key (`data_act_wake_needed`) that was superseded by the "no vehicle data" notice and is never shown. No user-facing change.

## [2.12.4] - 2026-06-09

A resilience release for the ongoing VW-side backend outage: the integration now rides out transient server errors quietly instead of treating them like a broken login.

### Fixed

- **VW portal outage no longer spams errors or triggers needless re-logins** (#428, #429, #430, #431). While VW's EU Data Act portal is in its ongoing outage, the data endpoints keep returning HTTP 500. We were treating that 500 as an authentication failure — so it logged an error every poll and kicked off pointless re-login attempts. A 500 is the portal having a bad moment, not a dead session, so it's now handled as "no data this poll" (the existing "no vehicle data" notice already explains the outage). A genuine 401/403 still re-authenticates exactly as before.
- **Token-refresh hiccups no longer look like a wrong password** (#438). When the VW token server returns a transient gateway error (HTTP 502/503/504) on an otherwise-valid login — common while their backend is flaky — the integration was treating it as an authentication failure: it popped up a "please reconfigure" reauth prompt and filed error reports for what is purely a VW-side blip. Now a 5xx on the token endpoint is treated as "VW backend temporarily unavailable": your entities keep their last value, the integration retries on the next poll, and nothing prompts you to re-enter credentials. A genuinely rejected refresh token (HTTP 400) still triggers a real re-login. Applies to every brand (Audi, VW, Škoda, SEAT, CUPRA).
- **Quieter during outages** (#435, #436, #437, #438, #439). Transient VW-backend 5xx errors — the kind above — no longer get escalated to the in-app Error Reporter. They're a server-side outage symptom, not an actionable bug, and were generating a stream of noise reports. Your entities stay available through the normal failure-tolerance window in the meantime.

## [2.12.3] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Everything's translated now — all eight languages, end to end.** We went through every string the integration shows and filled in the gaps: the newer entity names (battery temperature, climate zones, navigation charge target, parking-map links, plug LED colour, the "command pending" sensors and friends), the little help texts under the login and options fields, the "open the brand app" service, and the repair notices (wake the car, portal session expired, optional browser package missing, OLA headers outdated). Until now anything we hadn't translated quietly fell back to English, so non-English users saw a mix. EN, DE, NL, SV, FR, ES, PL and CS are now complete — with everyday wording for the car terms instead of literal tech-speak.

## [2.12.2] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **"No vehicle data" hint when the portal is empty.** When the VW EU Data Act portal logs in but returns no data, the integration now raises a clear Home Assistant repair notice instead of staying silent. It explains the likely causes — most often the VW-side portal outage that's been running since late May 2026 (which hits every tool, not just us), or a data request that isn't set up yet — and tells you the quickest check: open the VW data portal in a browser and see whether *you* can see your car's data there. If it's empty there too, it's on VW's side. The notice clears by itself once data starts flowing. Fully translated across all eight bundled languages (EN, DE, NL, SV, FR, ES, PL, CS).

Quick follow-up to the v2.12.0 VW EU portal beta, from the first round of live testing.

### Fixed

- **VW EU portal broke after a Home Assistant restart** (#393). The portal saves a cookie-session placeholder token, and on restart the integration reused it and skipped the login — so the portal session was never rebuilt and the next call hit the old (dead) endpoint with a useless token, ending in "No vehicles found". Now a fresh portal login runs on every restart, so the session is always re-established.
- **"No data request" no longer spams errors** (#393, #424). Until you manually create a continuous data request for your car in the VW data portal, the data endpoint returns 404/500 — that's expected, not a failure. The integration now treats it as "no data yet" (the car still appears, data fills in once the request goes live) instead of logging an error every poll.
- **Scout noise on Audi charging timers/profiles** (#423). Registered the deeper `chargingTimers` / `chargingProfiles` sub-paths and the DC auto-unlock setting the Scout kept flagging.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-06-07

The big one for VW EU. We confirmed live that VW has closed every token-based login route for passenger cars — the hybrid trick another project used now gets a hard 403 from Auth0, the code-flow needs a client secret we can't have, and device-login isn't enabled for the VW client. The only door VW has to keep open under the EU Data Act is the read-only data portal, so that's the path we built.

### Added

- **VW EU Data Act portal connector (read-only, BETA).** A brand-new cookie-based login + data path for VW passenger cars, using the EU Data Act portal. It logs in, pulls the vehicle's data export, and surfaces the high-value bits (charge level, odometer, range, charging state, doors, window heating, temperatures). Trade-offs: it's read-only (no remote climate/charge commands), updates on roughly a 15-minute cadence, and you have to switch on a one-time "continuous data request" on the VW portal first. Kicks in automatically once the old token logins fail. Marked beta — the live login is being validated on #388/#393 before we lean on it.
- **Brand-aware portal config.** The portal connector is wired as a fallback in every brand's login chain, so it now picks the right OAuth client + brand selector per brand (VW, CUPRA, SEAT verified; others fall back gracefully) instead of always using VW's. Foundation for offering the read-only portal path to more brands later.
- **Skoda trip cost.** Total / fuel / electricity / CNG cost for the trip overview, with the currency, when Skoda ships it.

### Fixed

- **Cars stuck showing "online" forever.** Some vehicles report a capture timestamp years in the future (a known broken-clock quirk on certain control units), which pinned the connection state to "online" with a nonsense last-seen time. We now ignore timestamps beyond a 5-minute window. Applies to every brand.
- **Scout noise.** Registered the climatisation sub-blocks (CUPRA/SEAT) and the battery-support / charging-profiles / charging-timers blocks (VW/Audi) the Data Scout kept flagging, so it stops re-reporting fields we already read. Closes the scout reports behind #411, #414, #415, #416, #417, #419.

### Legal

- Added `LEGAL.md` documenting the statutory basis (EU Software Directive Art. 6, §69e UrhG, Art. 21 URG, DMCA §1201(f), EU Data Act Arts. 4–6) and attribution for the open-source projects the portal connector's mechanics were adapted from.

## [2.11.4] - 2026-06-05

Bundle release covering the v2.11.3 fallout. After v2.11.3 unblocked the Auth0 state-token wall, the next bottleneck surfaced: the VW EU signin-service flow is a TWO-step submit (POST email first to get a fresh hmac for the password page, then POST password to a different URL). Plus a handful of upstream-sync fixes for Skoda + small parser additions from the latest scout reports.

### Fixed

- **VW EU signin-service 2-step SPA login** (#388 swebachus, #393 SniperWCW). v2.11.3 extracted hmac + postAction from the templateModel JSON literal correctly but then POSTed the password straight to the identifier URL — got HTTP 405 every time, because the email-page hmac is bound to the identifier session only. v2.11.4 does the full upstream-canonical flow: POST email + identifier-hmac → identifier URL, regex-extract the FRESH hmac out of the response (the password page), swap "identifier" → "authenticate" in the URL path, POST email + password + fresh-hmac + relayState → authenticate URL. Pattern lifted from the audi_services.py implementation.
- **Skoda charging-statistics timezone header**. The upstream charging-statistics replacement endpoint (which we adopted preemptively in v2.11.0) tightened its server-side parser to require `X-Device-Timezone: GMT` instead of accepting any Olson zone. Switched from `Europe/Berlin` to `GMT` so the endpoint stops 400'ing on accounts where the server got picky.
- **SEAT / CUPRA climatisation field-layout for newer firmware** (#411 heidle78 scout). The scout caught two new top-level keys in the climatisation response: `climatisationStatus` (state / remaining-time / outside-temp moved here) and `windowHeatingStatus` (front/rear states moved here). Parser now checks the new sub-blocks first and falls back to the legacy `status`-wrapped layout for older firmwares.
- **Auto-reporter empty-body issues** (#409, #412 — empty bodies). Some browsers silently drop the `body` query param when the final encoded URL crosses 8KB. URL-encoded markdown inflates ~1.5x, so the 6500-char budget we shipped overflowed in some cases. Dropped to 4000 raw → ~6000 encoded so even chatty error reports survive the round-trip.

## [2.11.3] - 2026-06-04

Bundle release. Five fixes spanning SEAT / CUPRA endpoint corrections, VW EU signin-service SPA auth, and Audi token refresh defense. Built from a fresh round of upstream-lib source-walks (pycupra const.py + connection.py, audi_connect_ha audi_services.py, volkswagencarnet vw_connection.py) plus the live diags from #392 (heidle78) and #388 (swebachus).

### Fixed

- **SEAT / CUPRA climatisation read endpoint** (#392 heidle78 v2.11.1 trace). We were hitting `/v2/vehicles/{vin}/climatisation` for the read which 404s — that path is the command prefix only (the start / stop / settings / window-heating POSTs hang off it). The actual read endpoint is `/v1/vehicles/{vin}/climatisation/status`. Restores `climatisation_state`, `target_temperature`, `outside_temp`, `aux_heating_*` etc. on every CUPRA / SEAT that's been silently null for these fields.
- **SEAT / CUPRA door-lock parser presence check** (same trace). The "sub-job absent" failure in `parser_stats.door_lock` was a stats-misclassification — the parser actually populates `doors_locked` + `doors_individual` correctly from `/v2/vehicles/{vin}/status`, but the presence check only looked at `mycar.access.accessStatus.value` which is empty on newer firmware. Check now accepts either source so cars don't show false-positive parser failures in the diag.
- **SEAT / CUPRA `permission_*` + `capabilities_count` plumbing**. The `/v1/vehicles/{vin}/permissions` URL we polled for the `permission_is_owner` / `permission_can_command` entities consistently 404'd in production — the canonical endpoint is `/v1/users/{userId}/vehicles/{vin}/relation-status`. Also added a `capabilities_count` diagnostic sensor for SEAT / CUPRA (already exists for VW EU and VW NA), cached for 24h so we don't hammer the capabilities endpoint on every scan_interval tick.
- **VW EU SPA login on the signin-service flow** (#388 swebachus, Volkswagen ID.7 Sweden). The Auth0 SPA branch we shipped in v2.10.x was Auth0-specific — it hunted for `state=hKFo...` tokens which only exist on the universal-login path, then POSTed to `/u/login`. Users routed through the legacy `signin-service/v1/<client>` flow with a SPA-rendered password page (zero hidden inputs) hit a hard "no Auth0 state token found" error. Now: when the page embeds the `templateModel: { hmac, postAction, relayState, ... }` JSON literal (the SPA shell does), we pull those three fields and POST to the signin-service authenticate URL with the proper body shape. Same approach pycupra and audi_connect_ha use. Also covers a softer fallback (relayState alone via URL / JSON / escaped-JSON) for SPA shells that don't ship a full templateModel.
- **Audi / VW refresh-token defense** (audi_connect_ha upstream PR #749 pattern). When the IDK token endpoint returns a fresh `access_token` but omits the `refresh_token`, we used to hard-fail with `AuthenticationError` and force a full re-login. Some IDK refresh responses do exactly that — the existing refresh-token stays valid for the rotation lifetime. Now: we keep the previously-known refresh-token when the response omits it, instead of throwing the user back to the config flow.

## [2.11.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **SEAT / CUPRA trip stats + aux-heating status** (#392 heidle78 v2.11.0/v2.11.1 trace). The trip endpoints we'd used since v1.x (`/trips/shortTerm`, `/trips/longTerm`, `/trips/lastrefuel`) and the standalone aux-heating status endpoint (`/api/auxiliary-heating/v1/{vin}/status`) all 404 on Formentor PHEV firmware — they're not the canonical OLA paths. Replaced with the actual ones the app uses: a single `driving-data/SHORT` for last-trip + lifetime totals + `recent_trips` list, `driving-data/CYCLIC` for per-tank / per-charge refuel events, and the aux-heating sub-block that already comes back inside the existing `/v2/vehicles/{vin}/climatisation` payload (no extra request). Should unblock `last_trip_*`, `lifetime_*`, `refuel_trip_*`, `recent_trips`, `aux_heating_*` on Formentor PHEV and likely every other CUPRA / SEAT that's been silently null since v1.0.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **SEAT / CUPRA `max_charge_current` enum → amperage** (#392 heidle78 v2.11.0 trace regression). v2.11.0's pycupra-verified `settings.maxChargeCurrentAc` reader now correctly hits the canonical key on Formentor PHEV MJ22-23 firmware, but that firmware returns the enum string `"maximum"` / `"reduced"` instead of an integer amperage. The HA `sensor.cupra_max_ladestrom` is registered as `device_class=current, unit=A, numeric` and blew up with `ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'maximum'`. Now: prefer the explicit integer field when present, otherwise map the enum to the canonical amperage values verified against zackcornelius's VW NA APK decompile (`maximum`/`max` → 32 A, `reduced`/`min`/`minimum` → 10 A). Leaves the field `None` when neither path produces a usable value.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-06-04

Cross-brand parser audit against upstream lib source code. Five parallel deep diffs (pycupra, myskoda, volkswagencarnet, audi_connect_ha + CarConnectivity-VW, CarConnectivity-connector-volkswagen-na) surfaced field-name and parsing bugs that have been silently returning null on every car for some time. Bundled into one PR rather than the per-brand hotfix chain pattern.

### Fixed (cross-brand)

- **Skoda driving range fields** (myskoda source-verified). `electricRange.distanceInKm` / `combustionRange.distanceInKm` / `secondaryEngineRange.distanceInKm` are scout-derived paths that myskoda's DrivingRange model does NOT include. Canonical keys are `primaryEngineRange.remainingRangeInKm` + `secondaryEngineRange.remainingRangeInKm` plus an `engineType` enum to decide which is electric vs combustion. Old paths kept as fallback for any firmware that genuinely ships them. `adBlueRange` is a flat int upstream, not a dict.
- **Skoda doors_open / windows_open** were reading from `access.doorsOpenedCount` / `windowsOpenedCount` which do not exist on Skoda mysmob vehicle-status (no `access` subobject). For years these sensors silently reported false. Now reads `overall.doors == "OPEN"` / `overall.windows == "OPEN"` per myskoda Status.Overall model.
- **Skoda driving_score** was reading non-existent top-level `score` / `drivingScoreClass`. Upstream DrivingScore model is per-period (`daily/weekly/monthly/quarterlyScore.main`). Now prefers `weeklyScore.main` then falls back through the other periods.
- **SEAT / CUPRA charging path-prefix** (pycupra source-verified). The canonical path is `charging.status.charging.*` and `charging.status.battery.chargeEnergyInKwh` on Born MY24+. Pre-v2.11.0 we only tried `charging.charging.*` (direct) so `charging_power_kw`, `charging_rate_kmh`, `charging_type`, `total_charged_energy_kwh` were silently null on newer firmwares. Now adds the `.status.` segment as the canonical primary, keeps direct as fallback.
- **SEAT / CUPRA `battery_care_target_soc_pct`** field name. pycupra reads `targetSocPercentage` (no underscores); we previously tried `targetSOC_pct` and other variants only.
- **VW EU / Audi `plug_led_color` double-write bug**. A second unconditional assignment at the end of the charging block overwrote a valid PPE-firmware value (`plugLedColor` on access or chargingStatus) with `None` from `plugStatus.value.ledColor`. Now consolidated into a single defensive chain ordered upstream-canonical-first.
- **VW EU / Audi `battery_care` parent block order**. Volkswagencarnet's `vw_const` puts the canonical path under `batteryChargingCare.chargingCareSettings.*`; we previously tried `charging.chargingCareSettings.*` FIRST and the dedicated batteryChargingCare block was a fallback. Flipped so the canonical wins.

### Added

- **SEAT / CUPRA min_soc** read at `settings.minBatteryStateOfChargeInPercent` on `/v1/charging/info` (pycupra `get_min_charge_level`). Sensor previously stayed null.
- **SEAT / CUPRA climate_remaining_time_min + climate_ready_at** wired. The OLA climate payload already shipped `status.remainingClimatisationTime_min`; we just never read it. Derived `climate_ready_at` ISO timestamp lets HA show a "ready by" clock.
- **VW EU missing selectivestatus jobs**: `activeVentilation`, `batterySupport`, `chargingProfiles`, `chargingTimers`. Without these requested, parsers that read from those blocks (active ventilation state at v2.10.0 Group A, next-charging-timer at #173) returned null on any car whose data didn't happen to ship inside a sibling block.
- **VW EU `measurements.rangeStatus.value.electricRange`** added as a third fallback in the electric range chain. Some pure-EV ID.x firmware ships only this leaf.
- **VW EU / Audi aux-heating legacy fallback** at `climatisation.auxiliaryHeatingStatus.value.*`. Older Audi A4 B9 / MIB3 cars ship aux-heating state under the climatisation parent, NOT under top-level auxiliaryHeating. audi_connect_ha references this legacy path; we missed it pre-v2.11.0.

### Added (cont. - new endpoint integrations)

- **Skoda dedicated warning-lights health endpoint** (`/api/v1/vehicle-health-report/warning-lights/{vin}`, myskoda Health model). Canonical source for dashboard warning lamps with per-category breakdown (engine / brakes / tyre / oil / fluid) and human-readable defect text. Previously the warning_* fields relied on data piggybacking inside other responses.
- **Skoda trip statistics endpoint** (`/api/v1/trip-statistics/{vin}`, myskoda TripStatistics model). Populates `lifetime_distance_km`, `lifetime_avg_fuel_consumption_l_100km`, `lifetime_avg_electric_consumption_kwh_100km` from the overview block plus `last_trip_*` fields from `detailedStatistics[0]`.
- **SEAT / CUPRA aux-heating status read** (`/api/auxiliary-heating/v1/{vin}/status`). We have used this host for start/stop commands since v1.x; the status read now fills in `auxiliary_heating_status`, `aux_heating_active`, `auxiliary_heating_remaining_min`, and `heater_source` which were null on every car before.
- **SEAT / CUPRA trip statistics** via three OLA endpoints (`/v1/vehicles/{vin}/trips/{shortTerm,longTerm,lastrefuel}`, pycupra references). Populates `last_trip_*`, `lifetime_*`, and `refuel_trip_*` with defensive field-name variants for both legacy MBB-suffixed and CARIAD-suffixed shapes.

### Fixed (VW NA - in-place corrections, full rewrite still scheduled)

- **VW NA SPIN flow algorithm + token field** (zackcornelius source-verified). The canonical hash is `SHA-512("{challenge}.{spin}")` (challenge first, period, then spin); pre-v2.11.0 used `SHA-1(spin + nonce)` which fails on modern Cox firmware. SHA-512 is now the primary attempt; the legacy SHA-1 stays as fallback on 4xx so users on older firmware are not regressed. The session token field is `carnetVehicleToken` (NOT `sessionToken`); both are tried.
- **VW NA Canada client_id** at `69eb3c39-d2be-4006-8197-37cc4971e8fe_MYVW_ANDROID`. CA accounts that authenticated with the shared US client_id were rejected on newer firmware.
- **VW NA OAuth scope** now `openid profile cars vin` (was bare `openid`). The NA IDP returns reduced consent + missing claims when only `openid` is requested.
- **VW NA field-name corrections**: `data.location` (not `vehicleLocation`), `data.readiness.readinessStatus.value.connectionState.isOnline` (boolean) as primary online signal, `chargingStatus.currentChargeState` (not `chargingState`), `chargingStatus.chargePower` (not `chargePower_kW`), `chargeSettings.targetSOCPercentage` (not `chargingSettings.targetSOC_pct`), `chargingStatus.currentSOCPct` for battery_soc (was on wrong endpoint), `climateStatusReport.climateStatusInd` (not `climateState`), `data.timestamp` (epoch-ms) as canonical last-seen. `cruiseRangeUnits == "MI"` now converts to km (was silently treated as km, miles users had ~38% underreported range).

### Added (cont. - post-audit upstream sync)

- **Skoda charging statistics endpoint** (myskoda PR #586 source-verified). POSTs to `prod.emea.mobile.charging.cariad.digital/charging_statistics` with a VIN-filtered date range and Skoda-brand headers (`X-Brand: skoda`, `X-Device-Timezone: Europe/Berlin`, `X-Api-Version: 1`). The legacy `/v1/charging/{vin}/history` endpoint started returning HTTP 500 for many users after the Skoda app update on 2026-05-15 (upstream issue #585). The replacement uses `monthSections[].entries[].{primaryValue.value, secondaryValue.value, sessionDetails.startedAt, sessionDetails.currentType}` to populate `total_charged_energy_kwh` (sum across all entries), `last_charging_session_kwh`, `last_charging_session_duration_min`, `last_charging_session_start`, `last_charging_session_current_type`, and a compact `recent_charging_sessions` list. Adopted preemptively because PR #586 has not yet landed upstream but the broken state affects every Skoda user on current firmware.
- **VW EU / Audi `chargeMode` selectivestatus sub-job** (volkswagencarnet PR #328 source-verified, merged 2026-06-01). CARIAD-BFF now exposes a dedicated `charging.chargeMode.value` block carrying `preferredChargeMode` + `availableChargeModes`. Independent of the auth crisis - this is a real additive backend change. Now populates `charging_preferred_mode` and `available_charge_modes` for VW EU / Audi vehicles (CUPRA / SEAT have already shipped these from OLA endpoints since v2.10.0).

### Verified aligned with upstream (no action required)

- **SEAT / CUPRA `app-market: android` header** already set in `_ola_headers.py` for both brands since v2.1.x. Aligned with pycupra v0.2.30 403 fix.
- **`tokentype: IDK_TECHNICAL` header** is not set anywhere in our codebase. Aligned with volkswagencarnet v5.4.7 removal.
- **VW NA OAuth scope** confirmed `openid profile cars vin` against zackcornelius HEAD source — both repo source and live API behavior verified.
- **VW EU auth situation**: refresh tokens dead, Play Integrity X-Assertion required, Python cannot bypass. Confirmed wide community consensus (volkswagencarnet pinned #989, o11e's APK Frida writeup, evcc-io). Our Data Act portal fallback is the realistic ceiling.
- **Skoda mysmob charging-history /v1/charging/{vin}/history**: upstream broken with HTTP 500 since 2026-05-15 (myskoda issue #585). We adopt the in-progress fix from myskoda PR #586 (rsa-wusel APK reverse-engineered) preemptively because the upstream-broken state hits every Skoda user on 2026-05-15+ firmware.

### Still pending (separate PRs scheduled)

- **VW NA write-side full rewrite** (lock/unlock HTTP verbs, set-target-SOC method + body shape, climate-settings PUT shape, departure-timer shape). zackcornelius HEAD now has the APK-decompiled reference: `GET /ss/v1/user/{userId}/challenge` → `POST /ss/v1/user/{userId}/vehicle/{uuid}/session` body `{idToken, spinHash, tsp:"WCT"}` → carnetVehicleToken as Bearer (not X-Spin-Session). Lock = PUT body `{"lock":bool}`. Verbatim port scheduled v2.11.1.
- **VW NA subscription/privileges** parser shape (zackcornelius reads `data.services[*].operations[*].capabilityStatus`, not a top-level `subscription` block) - v2.11.1.
- **Audi refresh_token KeyError defense** (audi_connect_ha PR #749 source-verified) - backend now intermittently omits refresh_token. Our refresh path needs same `if "refresh_token" in resp` guard - v2.11.1.
- **Audi IDK discovery URL preference** (audi_connect_ha PR #738) - verify `_audi_market_config.py` reads `idkLoginServiceConfigurationURLProduction` with fallback to `/auth/v1/idk/oidc/openid-configuration` - v2.11.1.
- **Skoda TripStatistics OverallCost/FuelCost fields** (myskoda v2.11.1 additive). Needs new VehicleData attributes + sensor.py registrations + 9-lang translations + currency-aware unit handling - v2.11.1.

## [2.10.12] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **SEAT / CUPRA field-name corrections cross-referenced against pycupra source** (#392 heidle78 v2.10.10 follow-up - still-null trace). v2.10.10's static-info fix guessed top-level field names on the garage response that don't exist; the actual data lives in nested sub-blocks. Deep-diff against pycupra (the established Python lib for OLA backend) surfaced four concrete bugs:

  - **model**: now reads `specifications.factoryModel.vehicleModel` (was guessing top-level `model`/`modelName`), optionally concatenated with `specifications.carBody` for the full display name.
  - **model_year**: now reads `specifications.factoryModel.modYear` (was guessing `modelYear` - note the missing `el`).
  - **manufacturer**: now reads `specifications.factoryModel.vehicleBrand` (was guessing top-level `brand`).
  - **odometer_km**: added `mileageKm` as the FIRST field-name variant on `/v1/mileage` (pycupra's canonical key, was missing from our chain so offline-state Formentor PHEVs came out with odometer null).
  - **target_soc** + **max_charge_current** + **auto_unlock_charge**: now read from the `settings` sub-dict on `/v1/charging/info` (pycupra: `settings.targetSoc` / `settings.maxChargeCurrentAcInAmperes` / `settings.maxChargeCurrentAc` / `settings.autoUnlockPlugWhenCharged`). Pre-v2.10.12 read top-level only and silently missed the nested data on most CUPRA/SEAT firmwares.

## [2.10.11] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Data Act portal SPA: 3 new state-extraction patterns + 2-source forensic dump** (#388 swebachus v2.10.10 trace). swebachus's v2.10.10 warning log showed the portal returns a pure-SPA shell as the password page: `password_html.contains '<input'=False, contains 'state'=True, contains '__STORE__'=False`. Three new extraction patterns target the actual shapes this means: (a) Auth0 native state signature `hKFo...` regex (state tokens always start with that msgpack 2-key map marker so they are catchable even when minified into a bare string literal); (b) escaped JSON `\"state\":\"...\"` for double-encoded inline payloads; (c) URL-encoded state inside the HTML body for `window.location = "...state=X..."` patterns. The warning log now also covers `landing_html` (not just `password_html`), prints the raw URL strings, and dumps the 110-char context window around any `"state"` substring so the next failing trace pinpoints exactly where the token lives or proves the page is purely JS-rendered post-bundle.

## [2.10.10] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **SEAT / CUPRA static vehicle info from garage** (#392 heidle78 v2.10.8 follow-up diag). Pre-v2.10.10 the parser never read `model`, `model_year`, `manufacturer`, or `firmware_version` from the OLA garage response, so every SEAT / CUPRA vehicle showed "Unbekannt" / `None` for those device-card fields even when the data was clearly present in the API. Now extracts them in `get_vehicles` with defensive multi-variant lookup (`model`/`modelName`, `modelYear`/`year`, `brand`/`manufacturer`/`brandName`, `firmwareVersion`/`softwareVersion`, plus a `specifications` / `vehicleSpecification` sub-block) and caches per-VIN like the existing licensePlate + nickname pattern.

## [2.10.9] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Data Act portal SPA: attribute-order-agnostic state extraction + forensic logs** (#388 Arno-MA-73 v2.10.8 trace). v2.10.7's HTML hidden-input regex required `name` to appear before `value` in the markup; some Auth0 SPA bundles ship the attributes in the opposite order and the v2.10.7 regex silently missed those. Now walks every `<input ...>` tag, captures `name` and `value` as two independent regex matches the way `idk.py:_parse_csrf_robust` already does for the main BFF flow. Adds `data-state="..."` attribute as a third extraction path. Plus full DEBUG forensic logs at every step in the SPA branch (landing/identifier/password URLs, HTML lengths, parser field key sets, state extraction source and first 12 chars on success, first-200-char dump of password HTML when nothing works) so the next failing trace surfaces what shape the portal actually returns.

## [2.10.8] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **CUPRA / SEAT PHEV classification** (#392 heidle78 Formentor diag). Some OLA firmware versions ship `engines.primary.fuelType="gasoline"` but DO NOT populate a combustion range in the `ranges` block on the same response. Pre-v2.10.8 the integration derived `has_combustion` purely from the ranges block, so a Formentor PHEV came out classified as `is_hybrid=False` and `has_combustion=False`, suppressing the fuel-tank / combustion-range sensors downstream. Now also treats any non-electric `primary_engine_type` (gasoline / diesel / cng) as combustion so the PHEV flag flips correctly regardless of which response branch carries the range data on a given poll.

## [2.10.7] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Data Act portal SPA: state token extraction from HTML** (#388 Arno-MA-73 post-restart trace). v2.10.6 fixed the 405 but then failed with "no Auth0 state parameter in URL" because aiohttp's redirect-following strips the state from the final response URL on some SPA flows. Now mirrors `idk.py`'s extraction order: HTML hidden input first (most reliable, Auth0 always embeds `<input type="hidden" name="state" value="...">` in the page body even on SPA), regex over hidden inputs as fallback, JSON-embed pattern as third option, then the URL query strings as last resort. Both `password_html` (most recent) and `landing_html` (original GET) get checked.

## [2.10.6] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Data Act portal SPA password POST 405** (#388 xeonixo + Arno-MA-73). v2.10.3 POSTed the SPA password to the parsed identifier-form action URL, which returned HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed for several users. Auth0 Universal Login actually routes the SPA password submission through the SAME `/u/login?state=<x>` URL as the identifier step; differentiation happens via the body's `action` field. Now mirrors `idk.py`'s SPA fallback exactly: form-encoded POST first, JSON-content-type fallback when that lands on 4xx or back on the IDP host, follow the redirect chain. State is pulled from the password-page URL with a fallback to the original landing URL.

## [2.10.5] - 2026-06-03

EU Data Act portal: no more manual click-through. When the integration is in read-only portal mode and you opt in via the new toggle, it kicks off the Custom Data Request on its own.

### Added

- **EU Data Act portal Custom Data Request auto-kickoff** (live-trace based). At startup in read-only `data_act_portal` mode, the coordinator checks each VIN for an existing 15-min Custom Request and creates one when none exists. Uses the verified `/proxy_api/euda-apim/` endpoints captured 2026-06-03: GET `metadata/partial` to detect, CSRF + POST `requests/partial` to kick off, GET `datadelivery/{Identifier}/list` to pick up the ZIPs. The portal accepts at most one active custom request per VIN at a time so the check-then-create order is critical; we adopt an existing request if one is already running instead of double-kicking. New toggle `eu_data_act_auto_kickoff` in OptionsFlow defaults to OFF because the kickoff implies a 1-month data subscription on the user's account at the portal.
- **Repairs issue on portal session expiry**. HTTP 401 on any portal API call now opens a guided `data_act_session_expired` Repairs issue pointing the user at the Reconfigure flow. Portal sessions are cookie-bound and not refreshable, so we surface the prompt instead of silently looping.

## [2.10.4] - 2026-06-03

Two power-user tools for keeping the auth chain alive when VW rotates client_ids.

### Added

- **APK watcher: auto-issue on new OAuth client_id**. The daily atlas builder already polled VW Group APKs and extracted client_ids; now there is a diff step that compares the latest extraction against everything wired into source. When a brand-new id appears, a labeled issue gets opened so the maintainer (or anyone) can promote it into the alternates list without waiting for someone to notice manually.
- **OAuth client_id override in OptionsFlow** (power-user). When the community spots a fresh client_id in a new APK before the daily watcher catches it, paste the full `UUID@apps_vw-dilab_com` into the new field and the resolver tries it first. All existing fallbacks stay in the chain. Empty / malformed values are silently ignored.

## [2.10.3] - 2026-06-03

VW EU users finally get a working read-only path again.

### Fixed

- **Data Act portal SPA password completion** (#388 caraar12345's trace). When the portal's password page is SPA-rendered, v2.10.2 detected it but bailed out telling the user the fallback in idk.py was the route - except that route is for the BFF client, not the portal client, so users on VW EU had nowhere to land. The Data Act portal flow now finishes the SPA-rendered password page itself with a form-encoded POST that includes `action=default` and the state lifted out of the page URL, then runs the standard token exchange. The portal client_id passes the Azure WAF where the main VW Android client_id is blocked, so this is the one path most affected VW EU users can actually use for read-only data.

## [2.10.2] - 2026-06-03

EU Data Act portal flow rebuilt against a verified live trace.

### Fixed

- **Data Act portal OAuth flow** (#388, #393). The portal client uses plain authorization-code flow with `prompt=login`, not the hybrid response_type we were sending. That mismatch was the source of the "unexpected landing URL - IDP may have rejected client_id" error several users hit when the live BFF strategies all failed and the integration tried the read-only fallback. Now switched to standard code flow plus PKCE-S256 plus a token exchange against `identity.vwgroup.io/oidc/v1/token`. Hybrid fragment delivery is kept as a defensive fallback so accounts that happened to work on the old path are not regressed.
- **Data Act portal state-string order**. Was `{country}__{language}__{BRAND}`, now `{language}__{country}__{BRAND}` per the live trace. DE/DE users worked by coincidence; non-matching country/language combinations were routed to the wrong portal locale.

### Added

- **EU Data Act portal usership-verification scaffolding**. New `check_verification_state()` and `submit_usership_verification()` on the scraper detect whether the one-time EU Data Act declaration is on file per VIN and can submit it on behalf of the user when an opt-in config flag is set. The Repairs / OptionsFlow wire-up lands in v2.10.3; the methods are usable from external code today.
- **Data request submission scaffolding**. New `submit_data_request()` and `poll_for_dataset_url()` for the async ZIP delivery flow. Endpoint shapes are best-effort against the documented form fields; verified shapes ship in v2.10.3 once a live trace captures the AJAX call that populates "Ihre Dateien".

## [2.10.1] - 2026-06-03

VW EU login hotfix. The v2.10.0 SPA fix unblocked one path, but several users still hit HTTP 403 on the authorize endpoint itself - the Azure WAF in front of `identity.vwgroup.io` started rejecting the Android user-agent some time on 2026-05-31. Same finding the wider HA-VAG community converged on this week.

### Fixed

- **VW EU 403 on authorize endpoint** (#388, #393). When the initial GET to `/oidc/v1/authorize` comes back 401 or 403, retry once with a plain mobile-browser user-agent. Picks up users blocked at the WAF without affecting accounts that already work on the Android UA.
- **VW user-agent bumped** to `Volkswagen/3.61.0-android/14` to match the current shipping APK. The old `3.51.1` string is what the WAF presumably flagged.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-06-02

The biggest single release so far. VW EU login is unblocked again after the 2026-05-31 backend change, parked cars no longer show all-Unknown, and SEAT/CUPRA gets its Energy-Dashboard story plus settable battery-care.

### Added

- **One service for every vehicle command**. Pick from a dropdown of 14 actions (lock, unlock, climate, charge, lights, window heating, wake, aux heating, ventilation) on any vehicle device. The individual services still work too, no automations break.
- **Wake your car before polling it** (opt-in). When the previous poll said the car was OFFLINE, send a wake first, then poll. Trades one extra API call for getting actual data back. Off by default.
- **See in-flight commands**. New pending-action sensors tell you when a lock/unlock/climate request the app sent is still being processed by the car, so automations can wait for real ack instead of guessing with sleeps. Closes #389.
- **Trip stats per tank or charge session**. 9 new sensors for distance, time, average speed, fuel and electric consumption, plus totals you can feed into the Energy Dashboard. Filled the long-standing gap in HA-VAG land.
- **Real warning-light data on SEAT/CUPRA** from a dedicated backend endpoint, with per-category booleans (engine, brakes, tyre, oil) plus a readable message list.
- **Set the battery-care preservation mode and target SoC** directly from HA on SEAT/CUPRA. Read-side was added in v2.8.1, this completes the write side.
- **Audi plug LED colour** wired up for Q6/A6 e-tron PPE. Older Audis keep the sensor hidden.
- **Real-time charging rate** on Audi + VW EU where the firmware reports it separately from the averaged rate.
- **Rich climate-start service** that lets you set per-seat heating, glass heating, eco-vs-comfort mode, continue-while-unlocked and target temperature in one call. Audi + VW EU only.
- **Charging history with power-curve points** for SEAT/CUPRA, so the DC-fast-charge kW-vs-SoC story finally works there. Diagnostic sensor exposes the curve in attributes, ready for Lovelace charts.
- **Group B: 7 more SEAT/CUPRA endpoints**. App notifications (count + last subject + severity), permissions (owner / can-command), engine + coolant temperature, charging profiles (same shape as Skoda already had), charging modes, a service to push charging settings to the car, and the public charging-station catalog now works on SEAT/CUPRA too.

#### VW EU field parity (Group A) — 10 new sensors

- HV battery min/max temperature (separate from the average) — useful for thermal-runaway alarms on long DC charges.
- Max AC charging current split into "what you set" vs "what the wallbox actually delivers".
- Born MY24+ AC connector auto-release flag + state.
- Optimised battery use toggle (longevity vs performance, distinct from battery-care).
- Active ventilation status + countdown to end.
- Rear sunroof + Cabrio roof-cover position.
- 12V battery health bucket (low / normal / high), distinct from the existing voltage sensor.
- Last-trip absolute fuel + electric consumption totals.

#### VW NA endpoint parity (Group C)

- Subscription + capabilities sensors on VW NA (Cox-backend). Pre-v2.10.0 SEAT/CUPRA + VW EU only.
- Modern Cox two-step SPIN flow for privileged actions. The old in-body SPIN still works as fallback.
- Modern lock/unlock endpoint, falls back to the legacy one on 404.
- NA-specific climate + window-heating endpoints, falls back to EU-style on 404.

### Fixed

- **VW NA "everything Unknown" on ID.4 US 2023** (#322 roberttco). Cox migrated the response shape; we now read both old and new shapes so accounts on either firmware get real values.
- **Scout stops shouting** about warning-light error envelopes and pending-action requests. Both are bff-internal wrappers, not real new data. Closes #389.
- **VW EU login broken after 2026-05-31** (#388 BalooDK + swebachus). VW migrated the password page to a JS-rendered shape and our form POST started getting "wrong credentials" even when they were right; the Data-Act fallback then mistook the SPA's `consent.js` asset for a real consent wall. Retry the same login URL with JSON content-type, and tightened the consent-wall detection so it doesn't trip on `consent.js`. VW EU users can log in again.
- **Tire pressure on newer PPC firmware**. Same data, new branch in the response; the parser now checks both branches.

### Documented

- Active-ventilation TODO from v2.4.x is cleared — Group A above shipped the parser and entities.
- Deeplink scheme TODOs are cleared. The smali extractions don't carry URI scheme strings (they live in AndroidManifest.xml + iOS Info.plist), so the shipped schemes stay sourced from each brand's launcher metadata.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-06-02

Hardening bundle: provenance canaries + weekly watcher, SPDX license headers across all Python files, and VW account-lock detection with a guided Repair issue.

### Added

- **VW account-lock detection**. After the 2026-05-31 ecosystem-wide VW Auth chaos surfaced a new failure mode (oliverrahner on volkswagencarnet#332 reporting his brand account getting locked for ~24h after too many failed token-refresh attempts), the coordinator now tracks HTTP 423 (Locked) and HTTP 403 with throttling-marker bodies on the token endpoint. Three such responses inside a 30-minute sliding window surface a Repair issue (`account_locked`) explaining the lock + next steps (wait, raise scan_interval, optionally switch to read-only Data Act portal mode). Auto-clears on the next successful auth. Native DE translation, EN parity for the other 7 supported languages.
- **Provenance canaries + weekly watcher**. New `custom_components/vag_connect/_canaries.py` declares 5 uniquely-spelled identifier strings, one per strategic module (auth resolver, Data Act scraper, DAG flow, Scout, watchdog). Each canary is also referenced from the module it watermarks so it travels with any port. Weekly cron in `.github/workflows/canary-watch.yml` queries GitHub Code Search for the canaries outside the `its-me-prash` namespace and opens a triage issue tagged `provenance` when a foreign hit appears. Apache 2.0 permits the port; the canaries make stripping the LICENSE + NOTICE observable.

### Changed

- **SPDX-License-Identifier headers** added to all 158 Python files. Files already carried the copyright + Apache 2.0 line; this adds the machine-readable SPDX identifier on the line below so REUSE / FOSSA / SCANCODE-class license scanners pick them up without parsing free-text. Mechanical change, no behaviour impact.

## [2.8.2] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Scout no longer auto-fires on the 6-key `.error.*` envelope the Cariad BFF returns when the `vehicleHealthWarnings.warningLights` job hits a 5xx upstream. Same shape as the v2.7.4 fix for `oilLevel.error` / `tyrePressure.error` / `auxiliaryHeating.error`, one branch deeper. Closes #384 (moltke69 Audi scout).

## [2.8.1] - 2026-06-01

Closes 11 SEAT/CUPRA OLA-field parser gaps surfaced via side-by-side comparison with the pycupra reference, after the v2.5.3 OLA v1/v5 fallback chain did not fix DanielBie's offline-Leon entity coverage (issue #306).

### Added

- 11 new sensors backed by OLA fields that the seat_cupra parser was not reading: `adblue_level_pct` (% tank level for diesel SCR, separate from the existing `adblue_range_km`), `cng_level_pct` + `cng_range_km` (CNG variants like Polo TGI, Mii Ecofuel, Leon TGI), `primary_engine_range_km` (PHEV / dual-fuel parity with the existing `secondary_engine_range_km`), `charging_preferred_mode` (user-selected mode mirror), `seat_heating` (any-seat-on aggregate), `parking_light`, `external_power` (charger is actually energising the cable, distinct from `plug_connected`), `battery_care` (preservation mode flag), `energy_flow` (any HV-battery exchange happening), `area_alarm` (geofence event). All entries phantom-protected via `_DATA_PRESENT_REQUIRED` so vehicles without the underlying field stay clean.
- Translations for the 11 new entities mirrored across all 9 supported languages (DE + EN canonical, the other 7 carry the EN labels until per-language polish; cross-lang parity test pinned).

## [2.8.0] - 2026-06-01

Stable cut of the v2.8.0 series. Promotes 2.8.0rc1 + 2.8.0rc2 from release-candidate to stable with no further code changes; the rc cycle ran under 24 hours and the only reported field issue (#378 from jwaeles) was fixed in rc2.

### What is new vs v2.7.4

- Five action items from the 2026-05-30 competitive scan: MFA / Email-OTP handler, coordinator auto-reload watchdog, headless EU Data Act portal zip scraper, FCM push live activation for Audi and VW, Repairs flow for DAG-to-hybrid_full degradation.
- Five v3.0 quick wins pulled forward: auxiliary-heating entities (switch + 2 numbers + sensors) for Audi and VW, `vag_connect.open_app` service with per-brand deeplinks, brake-service plus preferred-workshop sensors for all 4 Cariad brands, per-job parser-health telemetry in diagnostics, per-brand declared-vs-observed capability snapshot in diagnostics.
- 30-day device-bound IDP cookie persistence across HA restarts to skip the email-OTP challenge.
- Roadmap consolidation: five overlapping roadmap docs reduced to one canonical top-level `ROADMAP.md` with a new "Won't do" block listing 11 explicit exclusions.
- Dead-weight cleanup: Pydantic dual-write scaffold removed (blocking-IO warning gone), `euda.py` shim retired, 6 stale v1.x docs + 12 dead probe scripts deleted.
- README rewritten for all nine languages: DE + EN canonical, the other seven mechanically synchronised. Drops the v2.0 Big-Bang highlights and adds honest "Where we lead" + "Where the limits are" blocks.

### What changed during the rc cycle (rc2 hotfixes folded in)

- VW EU re-auth after the 2h token expiry was crashing in the Data Act portal fallback because the IDP migrated the `hmac` and `_csrf` fields out of plain `<input type="hidden">` markup into a SPA-rendered JSON block. The portal-side form parser now mirrors the multi-fallback strategy already in `idk.py:_parse_csrf_robust` (HTMLParser, regex over hidden inputs, form-action regex, and JSON/script-block extraction). Reported in #378.
- Two-way auth recovery for VW EU and Audi hybrid_full. After the hybrid flow succeeds, the integration now opportunistically exchanges the auth_code that Auth0 also delivers in the callback URL for a token set that may include a real refresh_token. Strictly additive: when the standard token endpoint is still Play-Integrity-walled the exchange fails silently and the hybrid-only TokenSet is kept (v2.6.0 behaviour preserved); when the wall has been loosened (as observed across the ecosystem around 2026-05-31) the upgraded TokenSet replaces the hybrid one and the next 2h boundary refreshes against `/auth/v1/idk/oidc/token` instead of triggering a full relogin.

## [2.8.0rc2] - 2026-06-01

Two-way VW EU re-auth recovery + hotfix for the 2026-05-31 IDP markup migration that broke the Data Act portal fallback. Same feature set as 2.8.0rc1 plus the two fixes below.

### Fixed

- VW EU re-auth after the 2h token expiry was crashing in the Data Act portal fallback because the IDP migrated the `hmac` and `_csrf` fields out of plain `<input type="hidden">` markup into a SPA-rendered JSON block. The portal-side form parser now mirrors the multi-fallback strategy already in `idk.py:_parse_csrf_robust` (HTMLParser, regex over hidden inputs, form-action regex, and JSON/script-block extraction), so a markup migration on either side fails loudly in the regression tests instead of in production. Reported in #378.

### Changed

- Two-way auth recovery for VW EU and Audi hybrid_full strategy. After the hybrid flow succeeds, the integration now opportunistically exchanges the auth_code that Auth0 also delivers in the callback URL for a token set that may include a real refresh_token. Strictly additive: when the standard token endpoint is still Play-Integrity-walled the exchange fails silently and the hybrid-only TokenSet is kept (v2.6.0 behaviour preserved). When the wall has been loosened (as observed across the ecosystem around 2026-05-31) the upgraded TokenSet replaces the hybrid one and the next 2h boundary refreshes against `/auth/v1/idk/oidc/token` instead of triggering a full relogin. Combined with the form-parser fix above this gives two independent recovery paths (refresh + full relogin via portal fallback) so a single endpoint flap on either side does not break re-auth.

## [2.8.0rc1] - 2026-05-31

First release candidate for v2.8.0. Bundles the five action items from the 2026-05-30 competitive scan with five v3.0 quick wins pulled forward, plus a dead-weight cleanup pass and a roadmap consolidation. README rewritten across all nine supported languages for v2.7.x reality (DAG MVP positioning + honest VW EU Play-Integrity limits).

### Action items

- MFA / Email-OTP config_flow handler (#1). The VW IDP can challenge for a 6-digit code on first sign-in; the flow now captures it cleanly instead of failing with a generic `cannot_connect`.
- Coordinator auto-reload watchdog (#2). When all VINs on the hybrid_full strategy show `failure_count >= 2` and `last_good_at` is older than 2x the scan interval, the coordinator silently re-authenticates without dropping entities. Mirrors the upstream community automation pattern but internalised so users do not have to wire it themselves.
- Headless EU Data Act portal zip scraper (#3). New `cariad/auth/_data_act_scraper.py` wired as Tier 3.5 (activates only when the active strategy is `data_act_portal`). Route A probes a research-confirmed JSON endpoint; Route B is fully scaffolded behind a new `CONF_ENABLE_DATA_ACT_BROWSER` OptionsFlow toggle that drives a headless Chromium via the optional `playwright` package (NOT in `manifest.json` — 100 MB Chromium download stays opt-in). Missing-dep surfaces a `data_act_browser_missing` Repair issue.
- FCM push channel for Audi and VW now ships live activation (#4). Decoded payloads (lockState, chargingState, climateState, alarm) are fired onto the HA event bus as `vag_connect_push_event` and trigger a coordinator refresh. The Cariad Firebase sender_id / api_key / app_id are still tester-gated behind a `NotImplementedError` in `_resolve_fcm_credentials` until the live APK extraction lands; the OptionsFlow toggle label moves from "EXPERIMENTAL" to "Live (beta)".
- Repairs flow when DAG degrades to hybrid_full (#5). New `auth_strategy_degraded` issue surfaces in the HA UI after 3 consecutive successful polls confirm the resolver has silently fallen back, with two guided remediations: re-run the browser-login setup, or pin the read-only Data Act portal mode (via the new `CONF_PREFERRED_AUTH_STRATEGY` option).
- MFA / 30-day device-bound IDP cookie persistence. The VW IDP issues a cookie after a successful email-OTP that suppresses the OTP for around 30 days; until now we discarded it on every restart, reload, and 2h re-login. `TokenSet`, `TokenStorage`, and `IDKAuth` all extended to round-trip the cookie. Latent bug-fix included: the storage layer never persisted `strategy` or `auth_cookies`, so the watchdog never saw the active strategy after a restart.

### Quick wins from the v3.0 roadmap (pulled forward)

- Standheizung / auxiliary-heating surface (quick win A): switch + duration number (5–60 min) + target-temp number (16–30 °C) + new `auxiliary_heating_status` + `aux_heating_active` + `auxiliary_heating_remaining_min` sensors. Audi + VW EU only; SEAT/CUPRA flow continues to require S-PIN. Capability map declares `auxiliaryHeating` for the two new brands.
- `vag_connect.open_app` service (quick win B). Fires `vag_connect_open_app` on the HA event bus with `{vin, brand, deeplink_url, action}` so a Lovelace card can open the brand's native mobile app on the calling device via `window.location.href`. Deeplink schemes are defined in `const.DEEPLINK_SCHEMES`; the per-brand scheme strings are marked `TODO(2.8.1)` for device-side re-verification once the v2.8.1 IPA/smali pass lands.
- Brake-service + preferred-workshop sensors (quick win C). Six new sensors: `brake_fluid_change_due_at`, `brake_pads_front_inspection_due_at`, `brake_pads_rear_inspection_due_at`, `preferred_workshop_name`, `preferred_workshop_address`, `preferred_workshop_phone`. Populated for VW EU + Audi (CARIAD-BFF `serviceCare`), Skoda mysmob `maintenanceReport`, and SEAT/CUPRA OLA `maintenance` when the dealer has wired up the service plan. Phantom-protected via `_DATA_PRESENT_REQUIRED`.
- Parser-health telemetry in diagnostics (quick win D). Each brand client's `parser_stats` dict records `{success, fail, last_error[:200]}` per named job (`oil_level`, `charging`, `climatisation`, `tyre_pressure`, `auxiliary_heating`, `trip_statistics`, `service_care`, etc.) and is exported in the diagnostics dump, so a silent parser regression on one job is visible while the rest of the poll succeeds. PII redaction reuses the existing JWT/VIN/email scrubber.
- Per-brand capability advertisement in diagnostics (quick win E). New `cariad/_capabilities.py` declares the expected per-brand capability matrix; `coordinator.capabilities_snapshot()` adds the observed-this-poll view and a `drift` list flagging declared-True-but-observed-False. Lets a missing entity be triaged as "brand never supported it" vs "parser dropped a field" without reading source code.

### Housekeeping

- Dead-weight cleanup pass. Removed the v2.2.0 Pydantic dual-write scaffold (one model, return value discarded everywhere, plus a blocking-IO warning on every fresh HA startup), retired the `euda.py` v2.0 shim that had zero callers, deleted 6 stale v1.x docs and 12 dead probe scripts from the v1.27 research era.
- Roadmap consolidation. Five overlapping roadmap docs reduced to one canonical top-level `ROADMAP.md`. New "Won't do" block records the 11 things we have explicitly ruled out (MBB direct-data path, Lamborghini/Bentley/Bugatti commands, VW China, etc.) so future feature requests can point at it.
- README rewritten for all nine languages. Drops the v2.0 Big-Bang highlights and adds honest "Where we lead" + "Where the limits are" blocks. DE + EN canonical, the other seven languages mechanically synchronised.

## [2.2.0-rc1] — 2026-05-16 — "Legen — wait for it — dary" (Release Candidate)


## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-17 — "Legen — wait for it — dary" (Final)


## [2.2.1] — 2026-05-17 — Phase 8 "alles parsen statt silencen" + Cross-Brand Expansion

- Cross-Brand App Atlas
- OLA watcher gains upstream as 3rd consensus source
- App Atlas covers all 7 brands

## [2.7.4] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- Scout no longer auto-fires on the 6-key `.error.*` envelope the Cariad BFF returns when `oilLevel` / `tyrePressure` / `auxiliaryHeating` jobs hit a 5xx upstream. v2.7.1 silenced the parent path but the single-level `.*` wildcard did not cover the 4-component child paths. Closes #371 and #373.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- Data Act portal auth: when the password form is missing in the response, scan the returned HTML for EU Data Act consent signals (`data act`, `consent`, `einwilligung`, `zustimmung`, `shape the future`, `datenverarbeitung`) before falling back to the generic credentials-rejected message. Surfaces a clearer instruction for users who hit the consent wall on `myvolkswagen.*` (issue #372).

## [2.7.2] - 2026-05-31

### Security
- Coordinator setup-failure log no longer prints the raw exception message at ERROR level. An aiohttp `InvalidURL` raised on the OAuth callback path could surface the full redirect URL including `access_token`, `id_token`, and `code` JWTs, all of which base64-decode to the user's email and a working access token. Log type only at ERROR; message at DEBUG.

### Fixed
- Multi-strategy auth resolver in `base.py` now also catches non-`AuthenticationError` exceptions (e.g. `aiohttp.InvalidURL`), converts them to a clean `AuthenticationError`, and falls through to the next strategy. Prevents the raw URL from leaking up to the coordinator's catch-all.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- Vehicle Data Scout no longer auto-fires on `oilLevel` / `tyrePressure` / `auxiliaryHeating` branches we just promoted in v2.7.0. Closes scout-report issues #366 and #367.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Browser-Login (OAuth Device Authorization Grant) for Audi, Škoda, SEAT, CUPRA. Open a QR code on your phone, sign in to your Brand ID account, confirm a short code. No password stored in Home Assistant, real refresh_token from the IDP.
- Trip statistics: `last_trip_*` and `lifetime_*` sensors populate from `/tripstatistics?type=shortTerm|longTerm`.
- `warning_messages` sensor surfaces every backend warning the manufacturer app would show (Audi STO / towing-bracket alerts etc), not just the hardcoded oil/engine/brake/tyre family.
- `oilLevel` and `tyrePressure` jobs added to the selectivestatus request. Populates `oil_level_warning` binary_sensor and the existing `tire_pressure_*_bar` sensors.

### Fixed
- Per-door, per-window, sun-roof, trunk-lock state now populate on locked cars (was only on unlocked).
- Outside temperature parser tries multiple backend key variants for Audi MY24+ compatibility.
- Window heating front/back parser tries multiple JSON shape variants.
- `wake_count_today` defaults to 0 instead of Unknown.
- TIMESTAMP sensors parse ISO 8601 strings to tz-aware datetime (cures entity-add failure on subscription_expiry_at).
- Cross-language translation parity. All 8 supported languages now ship the full config_flow translation set (browser_login, browser_login_approve, menu_options, progress, errors).

### Notes
- If field labels in the config dialog render as raw keys (`brand`, `spin`, etc) after upgrade, do a hard browser refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R). Home Assistant caches translations client-side and may not pick up the new keys until the browser cache clears.

## [2.7.0b11] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Trip statistics endpoint wired. `last_trip_*` and `lifetime_*` sensors now populate from `/vehicle/v1/vehicles/{vin}/tripstatistics?type=shortTerm|longTerm`. Closes Unbekannt on Lifetime Distance, Last Trip Distance / Avg Speed / Avg Fuel Consumption, Lifetime Avg Fuel Consumption.
- `warning_messages` text sensor showing every backend warning as `type: text`, comma-joined. Surfaces brand-specific warnings the hardcoded oil/engine/brake/tyre binary sensors miss (e.g. Audi STO / towing-bracket alerts that come through in the myAudi email notifications).
- `wake_count_today` defaults to 0 on first data load instead of None / Unbekannt. The counter only increments when the user uses the wake button; users who never wake the car now see 0 instead of "Unknown".

### Fixed
- Outside temperature parser tries multiple backend key variants (`outsideTemperature_K`, `temperatureOutside_K` under `outsideTemperatureStatus` and `temperatureOutsideStatus`). Closes Unbekannt on Audi MY24+ models where the key differs from the canonical Cariad name.
- Window heating front / back parser tries multiple JSON shape variants (`windowHeatingStatus` / `statusList` / `windowHeatingStatusList` / direct array under value). Closes Unbekannt on brands shipping the data under a non-canonical key.

## [2.7.0b10] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- `oilLevel` job in the CARIAD-BFF selectivestatus request. New binary_sensor `oil_level_warning` (Oil Level / Ölstand). Closes "Oil Level" Unbekannt gap vs upstream.
- `tyrePressure` job in the same request. Populates the existing `tire_pressure_*_bar` sensors and `tire_pressure_warning` binary_sensor. Closes per-wheel pressure Unbekannt gap.
- `auxiliaryHeating` job for future Webasto / standheizung parity.

### Fixed
- Per-door and per-window state was only populated when the car was unlocked (`overallStatus == "UNSAFE"`). On a locked car the parser left `doors_individual` / `windows_individual` empty and all per-position entities (Left Front Door, Sun Roof, etc) rendered as Unbekannt. Now always iterate the doors and windows arrays regardless of overall status.
- Trunk lock state was never extracted from the access response. Pulled from the doors array entry with name "trunk", populating the existing `trunk_locked` binary_sensor.

## [2.7.0b9] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- DAG browser-login Phase 2: URL and user_code now live inside the form schema as pre-filled fields, not just in the description. Description rendering kept failing on real installs (translation-loader miss or HA frontend quirk). Schema fields render reliably.
- Added a QR code selector showing the verification URL. Scan with phone camera to open the login page in one tap.
- Field labels chosen so the raw-key fallback ("verification_url", "user_code", "approved_in_browser") stays readable when translations miss.
- Persistent notification and WARNING log line from b8 kept as belt-and-suspenders.

## [2.7.0b8] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- DAG browser-login: URL and user_code now surface through three independent paths so at least one always renders even when the others fail. (1) form description (was already in b7), (2) persistent_notification fired on form first entry, (3) WARNING log line with both values. Defense against the empty-dialog-body symptom seen on b7 even after full HA restart.
- DAG browser-login form: switched from empty `vol.Schema({})` to a single optional confirm boolean. Empty schemas caused HA's frontend to skip description rendering on at least one install.

## [2.7.0b7] — 2026-05-31 — "DAG spinner-forever fix #3 — form-based URL display (beta)"

- After b4 and b6 both failed to reliably surface the verification URL + user_code in the show_progress dialog (HA frontend cached the progress description per flow id and didn't always pick up `description_placeholders` even when the show_progress task and step_id changed), Phase 2 is now rendered as a normal config_flow form. Forms substitute placeholders via the standard text-rendering pipeline which works reliably.
- New UX:
  - URL + 6-digit code shown as plain markdown text — fully visible and copyable
  - Submit button visible from the start
  - User opens URL in their browser (any device), signs in, approves
  - When done, clicks Submit
  - Background poll task validates with VW backend
  - If poll done + tokens → advance to entry creation
  - If poll done + error → drop back to brand picker (retry)
  - If user clicked Submit before approval was complete → re-renders form with a "still waiting for browser approval" hint
- Trade-off vs show_progress: lost auto-advance (user has to click Submit once they've approved), but gained guaranteed visibility of the URL + code. Worth it.
- Translation key added: `still_waiting_browser` (DE + EN).

## [2.7.0b6] — 2026-05-31 — "DAG spinner-forever fix #2 — split phases into distinct step_ids (beta)"

- Browser-login progress dialog now reliably shows the verification URL + user_code after the device_code is acquired. The b4 attempt at a single-step two-phase flow ran into HA's frontend caching the progress description per step_id — when the same step_id returned a second `show_progress` with a different `progress_action` and new `description_placeholders`, the dialog often kept showing the first (empty) description and the spinner appeared to spin forever.
- Refactored into two distinct step_ids:
  - `browser_login_pending` — Phase 1 only (request /device_authorization). Shows "Requesting login code…".
  - `browser_login_approve` — Phase 2 only (poll /token). Shows "Open {url}, enter {code}, sign in".
- HA tears down the first dialog cleanly between phases and renders a fresh one for Phase 2, so the placeholders apply correctly the first time.

## [2.7.0b5] — 2026-05-31 — "TIMESTAMP sensors fix (beta)"

- subscription_expiry_at (and any other ISO-string sensors with TIMESTAMP device class) now parse to timezone-aware datetime in native_value. Pre-fix HA rejected the entity at add-time with 'str has no attribute tzinfo'.

## [2.7.0b4] — 2026-05-31 — "Menu + DAG progress UX fix (beta)"

- Browser-Login / Email+Password menu now passes labels in the code instead of relying on the HA translation lookup — cures empty-chevron rendering when the integration is updated without an HA restart.
- Browser-Login progress: split into two phases so the URL + user_code populate in the progress text BEFORE the long poll begins. Previously the progress UI showed only "Waiting for browser approval…" with the URL/code never appearing.

## [2.7.0b3] — 2026-05-31 — "Hassfest + test contract fixes (beta)"

- Translations: moved progress key from inside step to top-level config.progress per HA schema.
- Tests aligned with v2.7.0b1 menu split and v2.7.0b2 5-header default.

## [2.7.0b2] — 2026-05-31 — "Audi token-headers fix (beta)"

- Audi email+password login: dropped the dummy x-assertion / x-platform / x-android-package-name trio from token requests — VW backend now rejects the dummy value and lets through requests that omit the headers entirely. Matches upstream v1.19.2+ behaviour.

## [2.7.0b1] — 2026-05-31 — "Browser-Login UI (beta)"

- New config_flow menu: choose between Browser-Login (recommended) and Email + Password (legacy).
- Browser-Login wires the v2.6.0 OAuth Device Authorization Grant module into HA's show_progress flow — open a URL, enter a short code, no password stored in HA.
- Available for Audi, Škoda, SEAT, CUPRA. VW EU + Porsche stay on the email + password path.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-05-31 — "Multi-Strategy Auth (Hybrid + DAG + Data Act)"

- VW EU now logs in via OIDC hybrid flow (response_type=code id_token token) — bypasses Play Integrity wall.
- OAuth Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) module for Audi/Skoda/SEAT/CUPRA — browser-based, password-less, refresh-token-friendly. UI wiring lands in v2.7.0.
- Per-brand strategy resolver with automatic fallback (up to 3 tiers per brand).
- In-house EU Data Act portal auth as last-resort read-only fallback strategy.
